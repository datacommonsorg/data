    """Logs a structured message suitable for creating log-based metrics.
        In GCP Log Explorer, the labels will appear under `jsonPayload`.

        Guidelines for GCP log-based metrics:
        - Keep logging queries simple and focused.
            - More query fields might increase the chances of false negatives.
            - Filter logs by resource.type to focus on specific resources. This is auto populated by 
                GCP and does not need to be set here.
        - The same log can be used to create multiple log-based metrics, 
            especially when it contains multiple metric values (e.g. count, latency)
            - If so, metric_labels can be used as additional filtering criteria.       
    Args:
        log_type: Log type identifier; used for filtering log lines when creating log-based metrics.
            - Published as `log_type` label in structured log.
            - Use a unique log_type to filter log entries when creating log-based metrics. 
            - Reduces the number of fields required in the filtering query. This simplifies the query.
            - This method is more robust and easier to maintain than relying on labels, 
                which might be shared by other, unrelated log entries.
        level: Log level ("INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR").
        message: Log message. Provides a summary for display in the log explorer
            but should not be used for log queries or metric label derivation.  Use `metric_labels` instead.
        metric_labels: Labels for the metric. Might not be required for counter metrics when log_type alone might be sufficient.
            - Used to derive metric label values and metric value. Also used in logging queries,
                 especially when creating multiple log-based metrics from the same logs.
            - For metric labels, use scalar values (string, number, boolean) whenever possible.
            - This allows direct assignment to metric labels, avoiding the need for regular expressions.  
            - When using the same `log_type` in different parts of your code,
              maintain consistency in the labels used to guarantee correct population of log labels.
