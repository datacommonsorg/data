# Prompt to generate or correct name sfor StatVars.
# Caller should provide the following parameters:
#  sample_statvars: MCF nodes of statvars with expected names.
#  context: Text string describing property:values used in statvars.
#  input_statvars: MCF nodes for stavtars for whcih name is to be added.
Generate the name property for each of the Node in the NODES section
where a Node is a list of property:value tuples. Nodes are seperated by empty lines.
Use the text in the CONTEXT section to understand the property:values better.

If the Node has a 'name' property, then correct any grammar or spelling mistakes in it
and convert it into a concise title that captures all the properties.

If the Node has a 'description' property, fix any English grammar or spelling mistakes
in the value.

If a node doesn't have a name, then generate a name based on the node's properties.
The name should capture all the properties in the node.

If a node doesn't have a description, then generate a detailed description based
on the node's properties.

Return the corrected nodes in the same order with the updated name and description values.

Here are a few examples:
