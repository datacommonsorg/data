    """Filters a DataFrame based on a set of explicit, disjunctive criteria.

    This function selects rows from a DataFrame where the 'StatVar' column
    matches AT LEAST ONE of the provided filtering conditions. The results of
    applying each filter are combined using a logical OR (union).

    Args:
        df: The DataFrame to filter. It must contain a 'StatVar' column.
        dcids: A list of exact StatVar DCIDs to match.
        regex_patterns: A list of regex patterns to match against the 'StatVar'
          column.
        contains_all: A list of substrings that must ALL be present in the
          'StatVar' DCID for it to be considered a match.

    Returns:
        A new DataFrame containing only the rows that match at least one of
        the filter criteria.

    Examples:
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame({
        ...     'StatVar': [
        ...         'Count_Person_Male',
        ...         'Count_Person_Female',
        ...         'Count_Person_U18_Female',
        ...         'Amount_Debt_Government'
        ...     ]
        ... })

        **Single Filter Examples:**

        >>> # 1. Filter by a specific StatVar DCID
        >>> filter_dataframe(df, dcids=['Count_Person_Male'])
                      StatVar
        0  Count_Person_Male

        >>> # 2. Filter by a regex pattern
        >>> filter_dataframe(df, regex_patterns=['^Amount_.*'])
                               StatVar
        3  Amount_Debt_Government

        >>> # 3. Filter by substrings (all must be present)
        >>> filter_dataframe(df, contains_all=['Person', 'Female'])
                           StatVar
        1      Count_Person_Female
        2  Count_Person_U18_Female

        **Multiple Filter Example (Union):**

        >>> # 4. Filter by StatVar DCID OR regex (union of results)
        >>> filter_dataframe(
        ...     df,
        ...     dcids=['Count_Person_Male'],
        ...     regex_patterns=['^Amount_.*']
        ... )
                               StatVar
        0           Count_Person_Male
        3      Amount_Debt_Government
