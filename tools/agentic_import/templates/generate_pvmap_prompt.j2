# CRITICAL DIRECTIVES & CONSTRAINTS

You **MUST** adhere to these rules at all times.

## Task Management

- **ALWAYS maintain a comprehensive todo list** for the entire workflow and
  update tasks as they are completed.

## File Handling

- **NEVER alter input data or metadata files.**
- **NEVER read entire data files**, as they may exceed the context window.
- **When inspecting data files, limit reads to the first 20 lines.**
- **ALWAYS read metadata files before data files.**
- **Single source of truth for config**: All `statvar_processor` configuration/flags must be declared in `metadata.csv` as `parameter,value` rows. Do not pass flags via CLI and do not embed configuration in `pvmap.csv`; the wrapper will pass only input paths.



## Reusability

- **ALWAYS reuse existing Data Commons entities and conventions**

# CORE KNOWLEDGE BASE

CSV data is imported into Data Commons through StatisticalVariables and StatVarObservations:

**StatisticalVariable (StatVar)** - Defines WHAT is measured (metric schema + constraints as integral components):
- **Mandatory properties**:
  - `populationType` - what's being counted (Person, Household, etc.)
  - `measuredProperty` - how it's measured (count, median, rate, etc.)
  - `statType` - statistical method (measuredValue, medianValue, etc.)
- **Constraint properties built into StatVar**: gender, age, race, educationalAttainment, employment, etc.
  - **Key concept**: Constraints are NOT separate entities - they become part of the StatVar definition itself
- **Optional properties**:
  - `measurementQualifier` - data adjustment method (SeasonallyAdjusted, Nominal, RealValue)
- **Naming convention**: Base name + constraint suffixes (constraints embedded in StatVar name)
  - Simple: `Count_Person` (total population count - no constraints)
  - Complex: `Count_Person_Female_Hispanic_Age25To64Years` (constraints Female+Hispanic+Age25-64 are part of this single StatVar)
    - This is ONE StatVar that counts people who are: Female (gender constraint) + Hispanic (race constraint) + Age 25-64 (age constraint)

**StatVar MCF Format (showing constraints as integral properties)**:
```mcf
Node: dcid:Count_Person_Female_Hispanic
typeOf: dcs:StatisticalVariable
populationType: dcs:Person
measuredProperty: dcs:count
gender: dcs:Female  # This constraint is part of the StatVar definition
race: dcs:Hispanic  # This constraint is also part of the StatVar definition
statType: dcs:measuredValue
# The above defines ONE StatVar with built-in Female+Hispanic constraints
```

**StatVarObservation** - The actual data points (WHERE, WHEN, VALUE):
- **Mandatory properties**:
  - `observationAbout` - place DCID (country/USA, geoId/06, etc.)
  - `observationDate` - time period (2020, 2020-01, etc.)
  - `variableMeasured` - StatVar DCID (Count_Person, etc.)
  - `value` - measured value
- **Optional properties** (also called observation attributes):
  - `observationPeriod` (P1Y=yearly, P1M=monthly)
  - `unit` (Percent, USD)
  - `scalingFactor` (100 for percentages 0-100, 1000000 for millions)
  - `measurementMethod` (CensusACS5yrSurvey, EstimateMethod)

**StatVarObservation MCF Format**:
```mcf
Node: dcid:USA_2020_Count_Person
typeOf: dcs:StatVarObservation
observationAbout: dcid:country/USA
observationDate: "2020"
variableMeasured: dcid:Count_Person
value: 331449281
observationPeriod: "P1Y"
measurementMethod: dcs:CensusACS5yrSurvey
```

**CSV → Data Commons Transformation**:
```csv
Location, Year, Population, MedianIncome
USA, 2020, 331449281, 65000
California, 2020, 39538223, 75000
```
→ Creates StatVars: `Count_Person`, `Median_Income_Household`
→ Creates observations with proper DCIDs:
  - observationAbout=country/USA, observationDate=2020, variableMeasured=Count_Person, value=331449281
  - observationAbout=geoId/06, observationDate=2020, variableMeasured=Count_Person, value=39538223

**Complex Example with Demographic Breakdowns**:
```csv
Location, Year, AgeGroup, Gender, Population, MedianIncome
USA, 2020, 25-64, Female, 85234567, 62000
USA, 2020, 25-64, Male, 82456789, 68000
California, 2020, 65+, Female, 3254678, 45000
```
→ Creates StatVars with constraints built-in:
  - `Count_Person_Female_Age25To64Years` - ONE StatVar with Female+Age25-64 constraints embedded
  - `Count_Person_Male_Age25To64Years` - ONE StatVar with Male+Age25-64 constraints embedded
  - `Count_Person_Female_Age65OrMoreYears` - ONE StatVar with Female+Age65+ constraints embedded
  - `Median_Income_Household` - StatVar with no demographic constraints
→ **Key point**: Constraint columns (AgeGroup, Gender) become integral properties of the StatVar itself, not separate entities
→ Creates observations referencing these constraint-embedded StatVars:
  - observationAbout=country/USA, observationDate=2020, variableMeasured=Count_Person_Female_Age25To64Years, value=85234567

**Key Insight**:
- **CSV metric columns** (Population, MedianIncome) → StatVar definitions
- **CSV constraint columns** (AgeGroup, Gender) → StatVar properties (age, gender)
- **CSV location columns** (Location) → observationAbout (place references)
- **CSV time columns** (Year) → observationDate
- **Each CSV row** → Multiple StatVarObservations (one per metric column)
- **Row transformation**: Combines place + time + constraints + each metric value with proper DCIDs

## Dataset Categories for Classification

Use these categories to classify your dataset's domain. This helps Data Commons organize and discover your data within the appropriate topic areas.

### Main Categories and subcategories

1. **Demographics** - Population, age, gender, race, ethnicity, citizenship, migration
2. **Economy** - Employment, income, poverty, business, trade, prices
3. **Health** - Disease, mortality, healthcare access, medical conditions, vaccines
4. **Education** - Enrollment, attainment, schools, teachers, students
5. **Housing** - Housing units, home values, rents, occupancy, housing conditions
6. **Environment** - Air quality, water, climate, emissions, natural disasters
7. **Energy** - Electricity, fuel, renewable energy, consumption
8. **Agriculture** - Farms, crops, livestock, food production
9. **Crime** - Crime incidents, law enforcement, incarceration
10. **Transportation** - Commute, vehicles, transport modes


## StatVar Processor: Converting CSV Data to Data Commons Format

### Core Function

The StatVar Data Processor is a Python script designed to convert statistical data from tabular formats (like CSV or Excel) into a structure that is easily imported into DataCommons. It achieves this by generating an MCF file for Statistical Variables (StatVars), and a CSV and tMCF file for StatVar Observations (SVObs). The core task is to process a data file using a configuration map to produce these outputs.

### The Conversion Process: A Mental Model

The fundamental mechanism of the processor is to associate property-value (PV) pairs with each data cell in an input file. This mapping is defined in a configuration file and is based on the strings found in column headers, row headers, or even the cell values themselves.


#### **Step 1: Configuration and Input**

The script takes two main inputs:

1.  **Input Data File**: A CSV file containing the data in a tabular format.
2.  **PV Map**: A configuration file (in csv format usually pvmap.csv) that defines how to map strings from the input file to property-value pairs. For example, a mapping could state that the header "FIPS Code" should correspond to the property `observationAbout` with a value constructed from the cell's content.
3.  **Metadata Configuration**: A configuration file (`metadata.csv`) that contains processor settings and parameters. This file controls how the processor operates and processing options. For example, `header_rows,1` specifies that the first row contains column headers.


#### **Step 2: Processing a Data Cell**

For each individual cell containing a statistical value in the input file, the script performs the following actions:

1.  **Gathers Context**: It collects information from the cell's entire context, including its corresponding column header(s), row header(s), and any section headers that might apply to it.

2.  **Collects Property-Values (PVs)**: It consults the `PVMap` to find PVs that match the strings gathered from the context. All matching PVs are collected. In cases of overlapping properties from different headers, the property from the most specific header is used, following this order of precedence: **cell -> column -> row -> section -> file**.

3.  **Resolves Values**: The values within the collected PVs can be dynamic. The script supports two powerful mechanisms:

    *   **Regex Parsing**: Extract parts of a cell's value using regular expressions with named groups. Each named group becomes a new property that can be referenced elsewhere.
        - Example: If a cell contains "25-30 years", you can use regex `(?P<StartAge>\d+)-(?P<EndAge>\d+)` to extract:
          - `StartAge: 25`
          - `EndAge: 30`
        - These extracted properties can then be referenced as `{StartAge}` and `{EndAge}` in other property values.

    *   **Value Substitution**: Build complex values by referencing other properties or the cell's own value:
        - `{<prop>}`: References another property's value. For example, `{@StartAge}` gets replaced with "25"
        - `{Number}`: References the cell's numeric value
        - `{Data}`: References the cell's string value
        - Example: To create a dcid, you might use: `dcid:{StartAge}To{EndAge}Years` which resolves to `dcid:25To30Years`

#### **Step 3: Creating StatVars and SVObs**

After all PVs for a data cell have been collected and resolved, the script separates them into two categories:

*   **StatVarObservation (SVObs) Properties**: A subset of the PVs are identified as belonging to the SVObs. These properties are `value`, `observationDate`, and `observationAbout`, `scalingFactor`, `unit`,  `observationPeriod`, `measurementMethod`.
    *   **Note**: `variableMeasured` is also mandatory for SVObs but is auto-constructed by the processor, never mapped directly in PVs
*   **StatisticalVariable (StatVar) Properties**: The remaining PVs are used to define the StatVar. This includes:
    - **Mandatory properties**:  `measuredProperty`, `populationType`, `statType`
    - **Optional properties**: `measurementQualifier`
    - **Constraint properties**: Properties that constrain what is being measured (e.g., `age`, `gender`, `educationLevel`, `income`)
    - **Excluded from StatVar**: Properties with capital first letters are treated as intermediate variables and NOT included in the StatVar definition
      - Example: If PVs include `{ProductName: "Coffee", productType: "Beverage"}`, only `productType` becomes part of the StatVar; `ProductName` is used for value substitution but excluded from constraints

    **🔑 Key Takeaway - StatVar Uniqueness**:
    - Any two data cells that share the same set of remaining PVs (after excluding SVObs properties and capitalized variables) will be observations of the same StatVar
    - **Inference**: The processor automatically deduplicates StatVars - each unique combination of StatVar properties creates exactly ONE StatVar, with multiple cells potentially contributing observations to it
    - **Example**: If 100 cells all have `{measuredProperty: count, populationType: Person, gender: Female}`, they all map to the single StatVar `Count_Person_Female`, each contributing a different observation (different places/dates)

#### **Step 4: Generating Output Files**

After processing all data cells, the script generates three output files:

1. **StatVar MCF file** (a file with the `_statvars.mcf` suffix, for example, `output_statvars.mcf`):
   - Contains unique StatisticalVariable definitions
   - Each StatVar appears only once with its complete set of properties
   - Example entry:
     ```mcf
     Node: dcid:Count_Person_Female_Age25To64Years
     typeOf: dcs:StatisticalVariable
     populationType: dcs:Person
     measuredProperty: dcs:count
     statType: dcs:measuredValue
     gender: dcs:Female
     age: [25 64 Years]
     ```

2. **Observations CSV file** (e.g `output.csv`):
   - Contains the actual data values
   - Each row represents one observation linking to a StatVar
   - **Mandatory columns**:
     - `observationAbout`: The entity being observed (e.g., `geoId/06` for California)
     - `variableMeasured`: Reference to the StatVar (e.g., `Count_Person_Female_Age25To64Years`)
     - `value`: The observation value (e.g., `8234567`)
     - `observationDate`: The date of the observation (e.g., `2024-01-01`)
   - **Optional observation attributes**: Additional columns for metadata like `observationPeriod`, `unit`, `scalingFactor`, etc.   
   - Example:
     ```csv
     observationAbout,variableMeasured,value,observationDate
     geoId/06,Count_Person_Female_Age25To64Years,8234567,2020
     ```

3. **Template MCF file** (e.g. `output.tmcf`):
   - **What is TMCF**: Template MCF is a schema file that maps CSV columns to Data Commons properties
   - Acts as a bridge between the CSV structure and MCF format
   - Defines how to interpret each column when creating the final MCF
   - Contains placeholders (C:columnName) that reference CSV columns
   - Example:
     ```mcf
     Node: E:output->E0
     typeOf: dcs:StatVarObservation
     observationAbout: C:output->observationAbout
     variableMeasured: C:output->variableMeasured
     value: C:output->value
     observationDate: C:output->observationDate
     measurementMethod: dcs:CensusACS5yrSurvey
     ```

**How the final observation MCF is created**:
- Data Commons combines the CSV file with the TMCF template
- For each CSV row, it substitutes column references (C:output->columnName) with actual values
- Constant values in TMCF (like measurementMethod: "dcs:CensusACS5yrSurvey") are applied to all rows
- This produces the final MCF with all StatVarObservation nodes



### Complete Example: US Census Data

**Input CSV** (`census_data.csv`):
```csv
place,date,Total,Total_Male,Total_Male_Under5Years,Total_Male_5to9Years
Alabama,2020,4893186,2365734,149579,150937
Alaska,2020,736990,384653,26684,26976
```

**PVMap Configuration** (`pvmap.csv`):
```csv
key,property1,value1,property2,value2,property3,value3
date,observationDate,{Data},,
# Column-level properties: 'place' applies to ALL rows with place values
# These properties are inherited by every observation in the dataset
place,measurementMethod,"dcs:CensusACS5yrSurvey",statType,"dcs:measuredValue",,
Total,populationType,"dcs:Person",measuredProperty,"dcs:count",value,{Number}
Total_Male,gender,"dcs:Male",value,{Number}
Total_Male_Under5Years,age,"[- 5 Years]",value,{Number}
Total_Male_5to9Years,age,"[5 9 Years]",value,{Number}
place:Alabama,observationAbout,"geoId/01",,
place:Alaska,observationAbout,"geoId/02",,
```

### Walkthrough: Processing Cell "149579"

This cell is at row "Alabama", column "Total_Male_Under5Years".

**Step 1: Gather Context**
- File: `census_data.csv`
- Row: "Alabama" (place=Alabama, date=2020)
- Column: "Total_Male_Under5Years"
- Cell value: 149579

**Step 2: PVMap Lookups**
```
date → observationDate="{Data}" resolves to "2020"
place → measurementMethod="dcs:CensusACS5yrSurvey", statType="dcs:measuredValue"
        (applies to ALL observations because 'place' column exists in every row)
place:Alabama → observationAbout="geoId/01"
Total → populationType="dcs:Person", measuredProperty="dcs:count"
Total_Male → gender="dcs:Male"
Total_Male_Under5Years → age="[- 5 Years]"
```

**Step 3: Collect & Separate Properties**
- **All collected**: observationDate, measurementMethod, observationAbout, populationType, measuredProperty, gender, age, value=149579
- **Observation properties**: observationDate="2020", measurementMethod="dcs:CensusACS5yrSurvey", observationAbout="geoId/01", value=149579
- **StatVar properties**: populationType="dcs:Person", measuredProperty="dcs:count", gender="dcs:Male", age="[- 5 Years]"

**Step 4: Generate Output**

**StatVar (MCF)**:
```mcf
Node: dcid:Count_Person_Male_Under5Years
typeOf: dcs:StatisticalVariable
populationType: dcs:Person
measuredProperty: dcs:count
statType: dcs:measuredValue
gender: dcs:Male
age: [- 5 Years]
```

**Observation (CSV)**:
```csv
observationAbout,value,variableMeasured,observationDate
geoId/01,149579,Count_Person_Male_Under5Years,2020
```

**Template (TMCF)**:
```mcf
Node: E:output->E0
typeOf: dcs:StatVarObservation
observationAbout: C:output->observationAbout
value: C:output->value
variableMeasured: C:output->variableMeasured
observationDate: C:output->observationDate
measurementMethod: dcs:CensusACS5yrSurvey
```

### Key Concepts

- **Multiple observations per row**: Each numeric column creates a separate observation
- **Shared StatVars**: Cells with identical StatVar properties share the same StatVar
- **Qualified keys**: Column values are qualified with their column name (e.g., "place:Alabama"), while column names are used directly as keys
- **Universal column keys**: Use a column present in all rows (like "place") for global properties instead of filename
- **Column-level property inheritance**: When a column name (e.g., "place") is used as a key, its properties apply to ALL observations from ANY row containing that column. This enables setting universal properties like `measurementMethod` that are shared across the entire dataset.
- **Property precedence**: More specific contexts override general ones
- **Required for observations**: value, observationAbout, observationDate, variableMeasured

### Script Usage

```shell
python3 stat_var_processor.py --input_data=<input.csv> \
    --pv_map=<pvmap.csv> \
    --output_path=<output-prefix> \
    --config_file=<metadata.csv>
```

**Note**: In this workflow, encode all processor configuration in `metadata.csv` and invoke via the wrapper script.

### Configuration

For this workflow, declare all processor configuration in `metadata.csv` (a `parameter,value` CSV). Treat CLI flags as documentation only; the wrapper script supplies input paths. Do not place configuration in `pvmap.csv` and do not rely on additional CLI flags.

The underlying script supports Python/JSON config files and CLI flags in general, but we standardize on `metadata.csv` for reproducibility and clarity here.

#### metadata.csv: Format and Parameters

- Format: two columns `parameter,value`
- Types: Booleans as `True`/`False`; lists as comma-separated strings (quote the whole value if needed); dictionaries/complex values as JSON-encoded strings (quoted)

- **Minimal Example for Simple CSV (MANDATORY FIELDS):**

```csv
parameter,value
header_rows,1
output_columns,"observationAbout,observationDate,variableMeasured,value"
```

- **Comprehensive Example with Common Parameters:**

```csv
parameter,value

# Mandatory configuration
header_rows,1
output_columns,"observationAbout,observationDate,variableMeasured,value,unit"

# Input configuration (optional)
skip_rows,0
process_rows,"1,2,5"
input_rows,100
input_columns,"1,2,5"

# Place resolution (optional)
place_type,"AdministrativeArea1,AdministrativeArea2"
places_within,country/USA
```

#### General Processing Settings

These settings control various aspects of the data processing pipeline. Default values are often present in the script.

**Workflow policy**: Express these settings in `metadata.csv` as `parameter,value` rows. Do not include them in `pvmap.csv`, and avoid passing them via CLI in this workflow.

**🚨 MANDATORY PARAMETERS:**

- `header_rows` (**REQUIRED**): Number of initial rows to be treated strictly as column headers. PVs from these cells apply to the entire column below them. Most CSV files have headers, so this should be set to 1.
  - Example: `header_rows,1`
  - **Critical**: Always set this for standard CSV files (defaults to 0 if omitted)

- `output_columns` (**REQUIRED**): List of properties to be emitted as columns in the SVObs CSV. **Must include at minimum**: `observationAbout,observationDate,variableMeasured,value`. If any additional observation properties are mapped in your `pvmap.csv` (such as `unit`, `scalingFactor`, `measurementMethod`, `observationPeriod`, etc.), they **must** also be included here.
  - Minimal example: `output_columns,"observationAbout,observationDate,variableMeasured,value"`
  - Extended example: `output_columns,"observationAbout,observationDate,variableMeasured,value,unit,scalingFactor,measurementMethod"`

**Input Configuration (Optional):**

- `skip_rows` (Default: `0`): Number of initial rows to skip entirely from the input file.
- `process_rows` (Default: `[0]` i.e., process all): A list of specific row numbers to process. If `[0]`, all rows (after skipping) are processed.
  **Note: Use only for debugging, not in final production configurations.**
  - Example: `process_rows,"1,2,5"`
- `input_rows` (Default: `sys.maxsize`): Maximum number of rows to process per file (after skipping). Useful for debugging.
  **Note: Use only for debugging, not in final production configurations.**
  - Example: `input_rows,100`
- `input_columns` (Default: `sys.maxsize`): Maximum number of columns to process per row. Useful for debugging. Can also be a list of 1-based column indices to process (not column names or headers).
  **Note: Use only for debugging, not in final production configurations.**
  - Example: `input_columns,"1,2,5"` (processes columns 1, 2, and 5 by index)

**Place Resolution (Optional):**

- `place_type` (Flag: `--place_type`): Comma-separated list of DC place types (e.g., 'City', 'County') to filter resolution results.
  - Example: `place_type,"AdministrativeArea1,AdministrativeArea2"`
- `places_within` (Flag: `--places_within`): Restrict place resolution to a specific country or administrative area DCID(s).
  - Example: `places_within,"country/USA,country/AUS"`


# metadata.csv Generation Guide

This section provides troubleshooting guidance and best practices for creating metadata.csv configuration files.

## ⚠️ COMMON METADATA.CSV MISTAKES TO AVOID

- **Missing `header_rows`**: Most CSV files have headers, but `header_rows` defaults to 0. Always set to 1 for standard CSV files
- **Missing `output_columns`**: This is now **MANDATORY**. Must include at minimum: `observationAbout,observationDate,variableMeasured,value`
- **Incomplete `output_columns`**: If you map observation properties like `unit`, `scalingFactor`, `measurementMethod` in your pvmap.csv, they **must** also be included in `output_columns`
- **Using CLI flag names**: Use parameter names like `header_rows`, not CLI flag names like `--header_rows`
- **Forgetting `places_within`**: Geographic data without this constraint can resolve to wrong places (e.g., Paris, Texas instead of Paris, France)

**Policy**: Do not embed processor settings in `pvmap.csv` and do not add extra CLI flags—`metadata.csv` is the single source of truth for configuration in this workflow.

## 🔧 metadata.csv Debugging Strategy

**SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING APPROACH:**

1. **Start with Mandatory Fields**: Begin with only essential parameters:
   ```csv
   parameter,value
   header_rows,1
   output_columns,"observationAbout,observationDate,variableMeasured,value"
   ```

2. **Test with Small Data**: Use first 5-10 rows of input to validate configuration using config "input_rows,5"

3. **Add Parameters Incrementally**:
   - Add `skip_rows` if initial rows need skipping
   - Add `input_rows`/`input_columns` for debugging
   - Add place resolution parameters if needed
   - Add observation properties to `output_columns` as you map them in pvmap.csv

4. **Common Error Patterns**:
   - **"No data in output"**: Check `header_rows`, `skip_rows`
   - **"Wrong place resolution"**: Add `places_within` constraint
   - **"Missing columns in output"**: Ensure `output_columns` includes all observation properties from pvmap.csv

5. **Validation Checks**:
   - Verify parameter names match documentation (not CLI flag names)
   - Quote values containing commas: `"value1,value2,value3"`   
   - Verify `output_columns` completeness against your pvmap.csv mappings

#### 1. Property-Value Map (`pv_map`)

This is crucial for mapping strings from your input data to Data Commons
properties and values. It can be a Python file defining a dictionary, a JSON
file, or a CSV file

Note: Keep `pvmap.csv` strictly for mapping source strings to Data Commons properties/values. Do not include processor configuration here; put all settings in `metadata.csv`.

**Format Example (CSV notation):**

```csv
key,p1,v1,p2,v2
<input-string1>,<property1>,<value1>,<property2>,<value2>
Child,populationType,Person,age,[- 15 Years]
```

**Key Features and Special Properties:**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: {Data} Variable Quoting Rules ⚠️**

**ALWAYS enclose {Data} in single quotes ('{Data}') when using it in:**
- **#Eval expressions**
- **#Filter expressions**  
- **#Regex patterns**

**This is because {Data} is replaced with the actual string value from your data, and without quotes, Python evaluation will fail.**

**Example of CORRECT usage:**
- `Status_Column,#Eval,"status='Active' if '{Data}' == 'Y' else 'Inactive'"`
- `Category,#Filter,"'{Data}' not in ['NA', 'N/A', 'null']"`

**Example of INCORRECT usage (will cause failures):**
- `Status_Column,#Eval,"status='Active' if {Data} == 'Y' else 'Inactive'"` ❌

---

- **String Mapping**: Directly map an input string to one or more
  property-values.
  - Example: `Men,populationType,Person,gender,Male`
- **Internal Variables for Cell Values**:
  - `Data`: The raw string value in a cell
  - `Number`: The numeric value if the cell contains a number
  - `Key`: The input string that was looked up in the `pv_map`
  - Example: `Age_Column_Header,age,{Number}` (This would map
    the numeric value from cells under 'Age_Column_Header' to the `age`
    property).
- **Variable Substitution**: User-defined variables (capitalized names) can
  store intermediate values for transformation, but are not emitted in the
  output.
  - Example:

```csv
Product_Name_Column,ProductName,{Data}
Product_Code_Column,productClassification,{ProductName}_Code
```

- **`#Format`**: Use Python f-string like formatting.

  - Syntax: `'<input-key>',#Format,"<prop>=<format-expression>" }`
  - Example: `FipsCode,#Format,"observationAbout=dcs:geoId/{Number:02d}"` (Pads FIPS code to 2
    digits)

- **`#Regex`**: Use named Python regular expressions to extract parts of an
  input string.

  - Example (extracting start and end age from "20-25"):

```csv
Age-Group,#Regex,"(?P<StartAge>[0-9]+) *- *(?P<EndAge>[0-9]+)",age,[{StartAge} {EndAge} Years]
```

  - Example using {Data} in regex pattern:

```csv
Country_Name,#Regex,"(?P<Country>.*) \('{Data}'\)",countryName,{Country}
```

  **🔴 CRITICAL: Always use '{Data}' (with single quotes) in #Regex patterns! 🔴**
  
  Note: #Regex expressions are wrapped in double quotes, and use single quotes for string literals within the expression.

- **`#Eval`**: Perform complex transformations using Python expressions.
  - Syntax: `<property>=<expression>`
  - Example (unit conversion):

```csv
Weight_Lbs,#Eval,"value={Number} * 0.453592",unit,dcs:Kilogram
```

  - Example using {Data} in eval expression:

```csv
Status_Column,#Eval,"status='Active' if '{Data}' == 'Y' else 'Inactive'",active,{status}
```

  **🔴 CRITICAL: Always use '{Data}' (with single quotes) in #Eval expressions! 🔴**
  
  Note: #Eval expressions are wrapped in double quotes, and use single quotes for string literals within the expression.

```
(Similar format: `SomeKey,#Eval,"value={Number} * 2.205"`)
```

- **Supported Functions in Eval:**
  - `format_date(date_string, output_format_string)`: Parses and formats
    dates. Default output is YYYY-MM-DD.
    - Example: `DateColumn,#Eval,"observationDate=format_date('{Data}')"`
  - `str_to_camel_case(string_value)`: Converts a string to CamelCase.
    - Example: `ProductType,#Eval,"productEnum=str_to_camel_case('{Data}')"`
- **`#Filter`**: Conditionally drop SVObs rows. If the expression evaluates to
  `False`, the SVObs is dropped.
  - Example: `ValueColumn,value,{Number},#Filter,{Number} > 0` (Drops rows where 'ValueColumn' is not positive)
  
  - Example using {Data} in filter expression:

```csv
Category,value,{Data},#Filter,"'{Data}' not in ['NA', 'N/A', 'null', '']"
```

  **🔴 CRITICAL: Always use '{Data}' (with single quotes) in #Filter expressions! 🔴**
- **`#ignore`**: If a cell's PV map results in an `#ignore` property, the
  corresponding SVObs may be dropped or the cell might be treated differently
  depending on context.
  - Example: `Not Applicable,#ignore,Value is not applicable`
- **`#Header`**: Marks a row as a header row or indicates specific properties
  from a cell should be treated as column headers.
  - Example: `Column A,#Header,"property1,property2=defaultValue"` This would mean if "Column A" is
    found, `property1` (value taken from cell if `property1` exists for
    "Column A" mapping) and `property2` (with `defaultValue`) become header
    PVs for that column.

**🚨 FINAL REMINDER: {Data} Quoting Requirements 🚨**

**Remember these CRITICAL rules when generating PV maps:**

1. **ALWAYS use '{Data}' (with single quotes) in #Eval, #Filter, and #Regex expressions**
2. **NEVER use bare {Data} without quotes in these expressions**  
3. **Double-check every expression before submitting**

**Quick Examples:**
- ✅ CORRECT: `Category,#Filter,"'{Data}' != 'null'"`
- ❌ WRONG: `Category,#Filter,"{Data} != 'null'"`
- ✅ CORRECT: `Name,#Eval,"fullName='{Data}'.upper()"`
- ❌ WRONG: `Name,#Eval,"fullName={Data}.upper()"`

## ### 1. PV-Map Generation Guide

Following sections contains detailed technical specifications, examples, and
instructions for creating the `pvmap.csv` file. Use it as a reference manual
when constructing the mappings.

### Guidelines to create PV map

**Here are guidelines to create a pvmap.**

**CRITICAL GUIDELINES**

**1. Always use column name as namespace to avoid ambiguity**

When mapping column values to properties, ALWAYS qualify the value with its column name using the format `<COLUMN_NAME>:<VALUE>` to prevent conflicts when the same value appears in different columns.

**❌ INCORRECT (causes ambiguity):**
```csv
S1,populationType,TotalEconomy
S1,counterpartSector,TotalEconomy
```
Problem: Both mappings use "S1" - it's unclear which column each refers to.

**✅ CORRECT (with column namespace):**
```csv
SECTOR:S1,populationType,TotalEconomy
COUNTERPART_SECTOR:S1,counterpartSector,TotalEconomy
```
Solution: Each value is prefixed with its column name, eliminating ambiguity.

**More Examples:**

Example 1 - Geographic codes in multiple columns:
```csv
# Incorrect:
US,originCountry,UnitedStates
US,destinationCountry,UnitedStates

# Correct:
ORIGIN:US,originCountry,UnitedStates
DESTINATION:US,destinationCountry,UnitedStates
```

Example 2 - Year values in different contexts:
```csv
# Incorrect:
2023,observationDate,2023
2023,referenceYear,2023

# Correct:
YEAR_COLUMN:2023,observationDate,2023
BASE_YEAR:2023,referenceYear,2023
```

**Why this is critical:** Without column namespacing, the import system cannot distinguish between identical values from different columns, leading to incorrect data mappings and potential data loss or corruption.

**2. Place Resolution - Critical for Data Commons Import**

Place resolution is critical in Data Commons. All geographic data must be correctly mapped to place DCIDs via the `observationAbout` property. The StatVar processor will attempt automatic resolution, but proper formatting significantly improves accuracy.

**Step-by-Step Place Resolution Workflow:**

**Step 1: Known DCID** → Use directly
⚠️ **ONLY use these when absolutely certain about the entity type**
- country/USA, country/IND (for countries)
- geoId/06 (FIPS codes for US states/counties)
- wikidataId/Q1234 (Wikidata entries)
- Example: California → observationAbout,geoId/06
- **WARNING**: The StatVar processor does not validate these - incorrect prefixes will produce wrong output

**Step 2: Country codes/names** → Use country/ prefix
- **ONLY when certain it's actually a country code or clear country name**
- For ISO country codes or clear country names
- Example: USA → observationAbout,country/USA
- **If unsure whether it's a country**: Use {Data} or contextual format instead

**Step 3: Complex places** → Provide context for resolution
- Combine place components using intermediate variables (Capitalized)
- Format: observationAbout,"{Place_Name}, {State}, {Country}"
- Example: City,State,Country → observationAbout,"{City}, {State}, {Country}"

**Step 4: Unknown/Ambiguous** → Let processor resolve (RECOMMENDED DEFAULT)
- Use observationAbout,{Data}
- StatVar processor will attempt automatic resolution
- **When in doubt, use {Data}** - the processor's auto-resolution is safer than incorrect prefixes

⚠️ **Critical Warning about Place Prefixes:**
- Incorrect prefixes (e.g., using country/CityName for a city) will NOT be caught by the processor
- Wrong prefixes generate invalid output that appears correct but is semantically wrong
- **Default to {Data} or contextual format unless 100% certain about entity type**
- Examples of dangerous mistakes:
  - Using country/California (California is a state, not country)
  - Using geoId/USA (USA should be country/USA)
  - Using wikidataId/ without verifying the actual Wikidata ID

**Important:** Use Capitalized intermediate variables ({Place_Name}, {State}, not {place_name}). These intermediate variables should NOT be added as constraint properties in the StatVar definition.

**Debugging Place Resolution:**
Configure metadata.csv to improve resolution:
- place_type,"City,County" (filter by DC place types)
- places_within,"country/USA" (restrict to specific regions)

**3. Understanding #ignore vs. Empty Mapping for Cell Values**

**CRITICAL WARNING**: `#ignore` drops entire rows containing that property. Use `#ignore` ONLY when you want to completely skip a row from processing.

To skip individual cell values without dropping the entire row, use empty mapping:

**Format for skipping cell values:**
```
<COLUMN_NAME>:<VALUE>,<IntermediateProperty>,''
```

This creates an unused intermediate property, effectively skipping that cell value while preserving the row.

**❌ INCORRECT (drops entire row):**
```csv
# This will drop any row where status code is M
OBS_STATUS:M,#ignore,Missing value
```

**✅ CORRECT (skips only the cell value):**
```csv
# This creates unused MissingValue property, row is preserved
OBS_STATUS:M,MissingValue,''
```

**More Examples:**

Skipping missing geographic codes:
```csv
# Skip cells with 'N/A' location codes
LOCATION:N/A,UnknownLocation,''
```

Skipping placeholder values:
```csv
# Skip cells with 'TBD' status
STATUS:TBD,PendingStatus,''
```

**When to use `#ignore` (drops entire row):**
```csv
# Drop rows marked as test data
ROW_TYPE:TEST,#ignore,Test row - exclude completely
```

**BASIC GUIDELINES**

1.  populationType. Examples populationTypes are Person, EconomicActivity, Debt.
2.  measuredProperty. Example measuredProperty are count, amount,
3.  value. This is used for the observed value that goes into the
    StatVarObservation. Map the column header containing the numeric data values
    to value,{Number}. If the numeric observation values have a units such as a
    currency, map the source string to unit,\<Currency code\>. Example:
    unit,INR, or unit,Kilogram.
4.  observationDate. This is used for the date of the observation in the format
    YYYY or YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD. For columns that have a date, map the column
    header to observationDate,{Data}. If the columns header has a specific date,
    then set it as the observationDate. Example, if the column names '2025' have
    values for 2025, use the following pvmap for 2025:
    observationDate,2025,value,{Number}. If there is a date range, then set the
    observationDate to the end of the range and use observationPeriod to
    indicate the duration, such as P1Y to year or P3M for 3 months
5.  Map any additional strings from the source to property,value from data
    commons schema such that the meaning of all the attributes that apply to
    data in a row or column are captured. A property in DataCommons begins with
    a lower case letter. A value in DataCommons is a reference to a node that
    begins with a Capital letter and uses CamelCase without spaces.
6.  Ensure that each key in the pvmap is unique. If there are multiple
    property,values for a single key, append them to the same row in the pvmap.
7.  If a property has no value, set it to an empty string in double quotes. For
    example, if a column has gender as strings, 'Male', 'Female', 'Total', then
    the property value 'gender,""' can be used for 'Total'.

**Here are a few guidelines to consider when generating pvmaps**:

1.  The first column in the pvmap should be a string or a substring from the
    source data csv files.
2.  The remaining columns in the pvmap are a sequence of property and value from
    data commons schema that represent that source string.
3.  The source string should appear only once in the pvmap and it can be mapped
    to one or more property values.
4.  All properties in the pvmap should be followed by a non-empty value or an
    empty string in double quotes “”.
5.  The value of a property can be a numeric quantity range, such as “\[10 15
    Years\]” with \[\<start\> \<end\> \<unit\>\]
6.  If a source substring delimited by spaces is repeated across multiple rows
    or column headers and it can be mapped to a property:value, then generate a
    set of property:values for the sub-string instead of repeating it.
7.  If there are dates as column headers, then generate property:value maps for
    possible future dates sing the same patterns as well.
8.  You can group pvmaps for strings from a column and add a comment string
    beginning with ‘\#’ before them describing the source context, such as the
    column header or column number.
9.  If there are multiple alternative candidate property:value for a source
    string, then add the best candidate with the source string and add the
    remaining ones as commented lines following the chosen one.

### Constraints

- The pvmap should have at least one source string mapped to the following
  properties:

1.  populationType. Examples populationTypes are Person, EconomicActivity, Debt.

2.  measuredProperty. Example measuredProperty are count, amount,

3.  observationAbout. Example: observationAbout: {Data}

4.  observationDate: Example: observationDate, {Data}

5.  value: Example: value, {Number}

- Check that each place does not get duplicate values for the same date.
- Add additional property:values to map such cells to a unique set of
  StatisticalVariables or unique SatVarObservations with different
  measurementMethod, unit or observationPeriod.

## SDMX-Specific Guidelines

When working with SDMX datasets, follow these additional guidelines:

### SDMX Structure Overview
**SDMX Structure Analysis**: The input metadata will contain SDMX structure definitions including:

- **Dimensions**: Used to categorize observations (e.g., TIME_PERIOD, REF_AREA, FREQ)
- **Attributes**: Provide additional context about observations
- **Measures**: The actual statistical values being observed

### SDMX Metadata Elements for Context Building

#### Key Metadata Fields
SDMX metadata provides rich semantic information through `<common:name>` and `<common:description>` elements that appear at multiple levels:

**1. Dataflow Level**
```xml
<structure:Dataflow id="WS_CBPOL">
  <common:name xml:lang="en">Central Bank Policy Rates</common:name>
  <common:description xml:lang="en">Policy interest rates set by central banks</common:description>
</structure:Dataflow>
```

**2. Codelist Level**
```xml
<structure:Codelist id="CL_FREQ">
  <common:name xml:lang="en">Frequency</common:name>
  <structure:Code id="M">
    <common:name xml:lang="en">Monthly</common:name>
    <common:description xml:lang="en">Monthly observations</common:description>
  </structure:Code>
</structure:Codelist>
```

**3. Concept Scheme Level**
```xml
<structure:ConceptScheme id="CS_COMMON">
  <structure:Concept id="FREQ">
    <common:name xml:lang="en">Frequency of observation</common:name>
    <common:description xml:lang="en">The time interval at which data is collected</common:description>
  </structure:Concept>
</structure:ConceptScheme>
```

**Note**: Multiple languages may be present (xml:lang="en", xml:lang="fr", etc.). Prioritize English when available.

#### How Metadata Links to Data Structure

**Dimension-to-Concept Linkage**:
- Dimensions reference concepts via `<structure:ConceptIdentity>`
- Each dimension inherits semantic meaning from its concept's name/description
- Codelists provide valid values with their own names/descriptions

**Example**:
```xml
<structure:Dimension id="REF_AREA">
  <structure:ConceptIdentity>
    <Ref id="REF_AREA"/>  <!-- Links to concept -->
  </structure:ConceptIdentity>
  <structure:LocalRepresentation>
    <structure:Enumeration>
      <Ref id="CL_AREA"/>  <!-- Links to codelist -->
    </structure:Enumeration>
  </structure:LocalRepresentation>
</structure:Dimension>
```

#### Additional Metadata Elements

- **`<structure:TextFormat>`**: Specifies data type (e.g., String, Decimal)
- **`<structure:Enumeration>`**: References codelists for valid values
- **`<structure:ConceptIdentity>`**: Links dimensions/attributes to concepts

#### Using Metadata for Semantic Mapping

Combine names and descriptions to understand the semantic meaning:
- Dataflow name → helps identify the dataset's purpose
- Dimension concept names → understand what each dimension represents
- Code names/descriptions → map to appropriate Data Commons properties
- Attribute descriptions → determine if observation-level or statistical variable property

### Core SDMX Mappings

#### 1. Standard Dimensions
* **REF_AREA** → `observationAbout`
  * ISO country codes: `{Data},observationAbout,country/{Data}` -> use **country/{Data}**
  * Specific: `USA,observationAbout,country/USA`
  
* **TIME_PERIOD** → `observationDate`
  * Annual: `{Data},observationDate,{Data}` (YYYY)
  * Quarterly: `2024-Q1,observationDate,2024-03` (use period end)
    * PV example for this conversion   TIME_PERIOD,#Regex,"^(?P<Year>[0-9]{4})-Q(?P<Quarter>[1-4])$",#Eval,"observationDate='{Year}-' + str(int({Quarter})*3).zfill(2)"
  * Monthly: `{Data},observationDate,{Data}` (YYYY-MM)

* **FREQ** → `observationPeriod`
  * `A,observationPeriod,P1Y` (Annual)
  * `Q,observationPeriod,P3M` (Quarterly) 
  * `M,observationPeriod,P1M` (Monthly)
  * `D,observationPeriod,P1D` (Daily)
  * `W,observationPeriod,P1W` (Weekly)

* **INDICATOR/SERIES** → `measuredProperty` and StatVar construction
  * Example: `GDP_GROWTH,measuredProperty,growthRate,populationType,EconomicActivity`

#### 2. Measures
The primary observation value in SDMX:

* **OBS_VALUE**: The observation value
  * Always map to: `OBS_VALUE,value,{Number}`
  * Or for column headers: `<value_column>,value,{Number}`

#### 3. Attributes
**IMPORTANT: SDMX attributes should only map to observation-level properties (not StatVar properties):**

* **UNIT_MEASURE**: Unit of measurement
  * Map to `unit` property with DC-compatible units
  * Examples:
    * `USD,unit,USDollar`
    * `EUR,unit,Euro`
    * `PERCENT,unit,Percent`
    * `INDEX,unit,Index`
    * `PERSONS,unit,Person`

* **UNIT_MULT**: Unit multiplier (scale factor)
  * Map to `scalingFactor` or use `#Multiply`
  * Examples:
    * `3,scalingFactor,1000` (thousands)
    * `6,scalingFactor,1000000` (millions)
    * `9,scalingFactor,1000000000` (billions)

* **OBS_STATUS**: Observation status flags
  * Handle special values:
    * `E,measurementMethod,Estimated`
    * `P,measurementMethod,Provisional`
    * `F,measurementMethod,Forecast`
    * `OBS_STATUS:M,MissingValue,''` (skip cell value - creates unused intermediate property)
    * `OBS_STATUS:NA,NotApplicable,''` (skip cell value - creates unused intermediate property)

* **BASE_PER**: Base period for indices
  * Map to `measurementMethod` with base year
  * Example: `2015,measurementMethod,BaseYear2015`

#### 4. Dataflow and Dataset Metadata

* **Dataflow identifier**: Use for mapping dataflow information to properties

* **Dataset attributes**: Often found in header rows
  * Map dataset-level attributes to default PVs that apply globally

### SDMX-Specific Mapping Patterns

#### Hierarchical Codes
SDMX often uses hierarchical classification codes (e.g., NACE, ISIC, CPC):

```
# Economic activities (NACE)
A,economicActivity,Agriculture
A01,economicActivity,CropProduction

# Products (CPC)  
01,productClassification,AgricultureProducts
011,productClassification,Cereals
```

#### Multiple Indicators
```
GDP,measuredProperty,grossDomesticProduct,populationType,EconomicActivity
INFLATION,measuredProperty,inflationRate,populationType,EconomicActivity,statType,growthRate
UNEMPLOYMENT,measuredProperty,unemploymentRate,populationType,Person,employment,Unemployed
```

#### Standard Code Lists
```
# ISO 4217 Currency
USD,unit,USDollar

# ISO 3166 Country
USA,observationAbout,country/USA
```

#### Time Series Types
```
YOY,statType,growthRate,comparisonPeriod,P1Y
QOQ,statType,growthRate,comparisonPeriod,P3M
AVG,statType,meanValue
```

### Critical Processing Rules for SDMX

#### Metadata Extraction and Usage Rules

1. **Parse and Extract Metadata Fields**:
   * Extract `<common:name>` and `<common:description>` from all levels (dataflow, codelists, concepts)
   * Use these to build semantic context for better PV mapping generation
   * Store metadata in comments or use for generating descriptive StatVar names

2. **Language Priority**:
   * When multiple languages exist (xml:lang attributes), prioritize English ("en")
   * If English unavailable, select any available language consistently
   * Use `#Eval` with string manipulation if needed to handle multi-language labels

3. **Constraint-Based Code Selection**:
   * **CRITICAL**: Check for `<structure:Constraints>` in metadata FIRST
   * If constraints exist, map ONLY the code values specified in constraints (not entire codelist)
   * If no constraints, use full codelist but sample data to verify which codes actually appear
   * This optimization prevents creating unnecessary mappings and reduces processing time

4. **Semantic Context Building**:
   * Combine dataflow name + dimension names + code descriptions to generate meaningful StatVar names
   * Use concept descriptions to determine appropriate Data Commons properties
   * Example: "Central Bank Policy Rates" + "Monthly" + "Argentina" → helps map to appropriate properties

#### Data Processing Rules

5. **Column Selection**: Specify relevant columns in metadata configuration to optimize processing:
   * Add `input_columns,"REF_AREA,TIME_PERIOD,OBS_VALUE,UNIT_MEASURE"` to focus on essential columns
   * Exclude metadata or auxiliary columns that don't contribute to StatVars

6. **Preserve Dimension Combinations**: Ensure each unique combination of dimensions maps to a distinct StatisticalVariable

7. **Handle Missing Values**: Use `#Filter` or `#ignore` for SDMX missing value codes (M, NA, ":", "-")

8. **Frequency Alignment**: When mixing frequencies, ensure proper date formatting:
   * Annual: YYYY
   * Quarterly: YYYY-MM (using last month of quarter)
   * Monthly: YYYY-MM
   * Daily: YYYY-MM-DD

9. **Version Management**: For datasets with revisions, use `measurementMethod` to indicate revision status

# CORE TASK

Your primary goal is to analyze the provided CSV data and generate a complete
and valid `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_pvmap.csv` and `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_metadata.csv` files which can be used with Statvar
processor tool to produce the final DataCommons artifacts.

## 📌 IMPORTANT: FILE NAMING CONVENTION

### Why This Naming Convention?

This naming convention allows multiple datasets to be processed in the same working directory without conflicts. Each dataset gets its own unique prefix based on the output path.

**Example Scenario**: Processing multiple datasets in the same directory:
- Input: `gdp.csv` → Output path: `output/gdp` → Creates: `output/gdp_pvmap.csv`, `output/gdp_metadata.csv`, `output/gdp.csv`
- Input: `employment.csv` → Output path: `output/employment` → Creates: `output/employment_pvmap.csv`, `output/employment_metadata.csv`, `output/employment.csv`
- Input: `population.csv` → Output path: `results/2024/population` → Creates: `results/2024/population_pvmap.csv`, `results/2024/population_metadata.csv`, `results/2024/population.csv`

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Multiple datasets can share the same output directory
- ✅ Each dataset's files are clearly identified
- ✅ No file conflicts or overwrites
- ✅ Easy to organize outputs by topic or date

**Current Task**: For this specific run, your output path is `{{output_path}}`.

Throughout this documentation, you will see references to generic file names.
**You MUST use the following specific file names for this task:**

| Documentation Reference | Actual File You Must Create |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| `pvmap.csv` | `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_pvmap.csv` |
| `metadata.csv` | `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_metadata.csv` |
| `output.csv` | `{{output_path}}.csv` |

**Example**: When the documentation says "create pvmap.csv", you must actually create `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_pvmap.csv`

**REMEMBER**: Whenever you see generic file names in the instructions, always use the specific names with the output path prefix.

# WORKFLOW & INSTRUCTIONS

## 🚨 CRITICAL ITERATION CONTROL 🚨

**MAXIMUM ATTEMPTS ALLOWED**: {{max_iterations}}

### Iteration Rules - READ CAREFULLY:

1. **INITIALIZE**: You will start with "**ATTEMPT 1 of {{max_iterations}}**"
2. **TRACK STATE**: Before each statvar processor execution, clearly state your current attempt number
3. **DECISION LOGIC**: After each attempt:
   ```
   IF processor succeeds (exit code 0) AND output.csv passes all validation checklist items:
       → OUTPUT: "SUCCESS: Completed on attempt X of {{max_iterations}}"
       → STOP IMMEDIATELY - DO NOT **CONTINUE**
   
   ELIF current_attempt < {{max_iterations}}:
       → OUTPUT: "ATTEMPT X FAILED - Starting attempt X+1 of {{max_iterations}}"
       → Analyze error, fix PV map, increment attempt counter, retry
   
   ELSE (current_attempt >= {{max_iterations}}):
       → OUTPUT: "⛔ ITERATION LIMIT REACHED: Failed after {{max_iterations}} attempts"
       → OUTPUT: "Final status: FAILED - Manual intervention required"
       → STOP IMMEDIATELY - DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE ATTEMPTS
   ```

4. **MANDATORY OUTPUTS**: You MUST clearly output your attempt number and final status
5. **HARD STOP**: When {{max_iterations}} attempts are reached, you MUST stop completely

**STRICTLY** follow this precise workflow to complete your task. ALWAYS
maintain a comprehensive todo list for the entire workflow and update tasks as
they are completed.

Follow these steps sequentially.

**1. Analyze All Inputs**

- Input files and configuration is listed in `INPUT DATA FOR THIS RUN` section
  below.
- **Carefully** examine examine **sample** input data `input_data` and metadata
  `input_metadata` files to understand the structure and content of the data.

{% if dataset_type == 'sdmx' -%}

- **SDMX Analysis**: For SDMX datasets, pay special attention to:
  - SDMX data structure definitions (DSD) in the metadata
  - Dimension definitions and their codelists
  - Attribute definitions and their usage
  - Measure definitions and their statistical concepts
  - **IMPORTANT**: Check for `<structure:Constraints>` - if present, focus ONLY on codes specified there
  - Frequency and time period specifications
  
- **Extract Semantic Context**: Refer to **"SDMX Metadata Elements for Context Building"** section:
  - Extract `<common:name>` and `<common:description>` from dataflows, codelists, and concepts
  - Use these metadata fields to understand the semantic meaning of data elements
  - Build context to help generate accurate PV mappings
  
- **Apply SDMX Rules**: Follow **"Critical Processing Rules for SDMX"** section:
  - Prioritize constraint-based code selection
  - Handle multi-language labels appropriately
  - Use metadata to generate meaningful StatVar names

  {%- endif %}

**2. Generate `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_pvmap.csv` and `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_metadata.csv`**

- Create the `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_pvmap.csv` file, mapping the source data columns to DataCommons properties based on your findings.
- Create the `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_metadata.csv` file and define the necessary `statvar_processor` configuration parameters within it.
- Configuration rule: All processor flags/settings must live in `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_metadata.csv`. Do not embed configuration in `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_pvmap.csv` and do not rely on extra CLI flags.
### Validation Checklist

While generating the files, ensure:

#### PV Map Validation:
- [ ] **StatVar mandatory properties mapped** - populationType, measuredProperty, statType
- [ ] **StatVar optional properties checked** - measurementQualifier (if applicable)
- [ ] **Only relevant constraint properties included** - Verify constraint properties are appropriate; intermediate properties with capital first letters excluded from StatVar definition
- [ ] **StatVarObservation mandatory properties mapped** - observationAbout, observationDate, value
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Do NOT map variableMeasured** - This mandatory property points to StatVar but is auto-constructed by processor from other PV mappings, never map it directly
- [ ] **StatVarObservation optional properties checked** - observationPeriod, unit, scalingFactor, measurementMethod (if applicable)
- [ ] **Place references follow resolution workflow** - Known DCIDs (geoId/06, country/USA), contextual format for complex places ("{City}, {State}"), or {Data} for auto-resolution
- [ ] **Place resolution metadata configured** - place_type and places_within in metadata.csv if needed for disambiguation
- [ ] **Unit measures follow DC conventions** - Use standard Data Commons units
- [ ] **Special/missing values mapped appropriately** - Use `#ignore` ONLY to drop entire rows. For skipping individual cell values, use empty mapping: `column:value,IntermediateProperty,''` (preserves row, skips cell)

#### Metadata CSV Validation:
- [ ] **{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_metadata.csv covers processor flags** - Includes required parameters (e.g., `header_rows`)
- [ ] **No config in {{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_pvmap.csv** - `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_pvmap.csv` contains only PV mappings, not processor settings
- [ ] **No extra CLI flags** - Configuration is exclusively in `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_metadata.csv`; wrapper provides input paths
- [ ] **Parameter names match documentation** - Not CLI flag names
- [ ] **Quote values containing commas** - `key,"value1,value2,value3"`

{% if dataset_type == 'sdmx' -%}

#### Additional SDMX-Specific Validations:

For SDMX datasets, also ensure:

- [ ] **All dimension codes are mapped** - Check `<structure:Constraints>` if present, otherwise verify all used codes from data
- [ ] **Time period format is consistent with frequency** - YYYY (annual), YYYY-MM (monthly/quarterly end), YYYY-MM-DD (daily)
- [ ] **Unit measures are DC-compatible** - Use USDollar not USD, Percent not PERCENT, Euro not EUR
- [ ] **Missing value codes are handled** - Map M, NA, ":", "-" using empty mappings (e.g., `COLUMN:M,MissingValue,''`) to skip cell values without dropping rows
- [ ] **Scaling factors are correctly applied** - UNIT_MULT mapped to `scalingFactor` (3→1000, 6→1000000, 9→1000000000)
- [ ] **Each dimension combination produces unique StatVars** - No duplicate place/date/variable combinations

{%- endif %}

**5. Run the Processor**

**📋 BEFORE EXECUTION**: Clearly state "**ATTEMPT [X] of {{max_iterations}}**: Running statvar processor"

- Execute the following commands to generate the final output and backup:

```bash
# Run statvar processor using dedicated script
{{script_dir}}/agentic_import/run_statvar_processor.sh \
  --python "{{python_interpreter}}" \
  --script-dir "{{script_dir}}" \
  --working-dir "{{working_dir}}" \
  --input-data "{{input_data}}" \
  --gemini-run-id "{{gemini_run_id}}" \
  --output-path "{{output_path}}"
```

The wrapper reads `metadata.csv` for all processor configuration. Do not add extra flags to this command.

**6. Validate the Output and Apply Iteration Control**

**📊 VALIDATION CHECKLIST**:
- Check the command exit code (0 = success, non-zero = failure)
- Verify that `{{working_dir}}/{{output_path}}.csv` exists and is not empty
- Confirm no duplicate entries for same place, date, and variable
- **Verify output.csv contains all required columns**: Must include at minimum `observationAbout`, `observationDate`, `variableMeasured`, `value`
- **Verify complete column mapping**: Any observation properties mapped in {{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_pvmap.csv (like `unit`, `scalingFactor`, `measurementMethod`, `observationPeriod`) must be present as columns in `{{working_dir}}/{{output_path}}.csv`
- **Verify `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_metadata.csv` completeness**: Confirm both `header_rows` and `output_columns` parameters are present and correctly specified

**🎯 DECISION LOGIC - APPLY THIS EXACTLY**:

```
CURRENT_ATTEMPT = [Your current attempt number]

IF all items in the VALIDATION CHECKLIST above pass:
    → OUTPUT: "✅ SUCCESS: PV map generation completed successfully on attempt CURRENT_ATTEMPT of {{max_iterations}}"
    → STOP EXECUTION IMMEDIATELY
    → DO NOT PROCEED TO ANY OTHER STEPS

ELIF CURRENT_ATTEMPT < {{max_iterations}}:
    → OUTPUT: "❌ ATTEMPT CURRENT_ATTEMPT FAILED - Error details: [describe specific error]"
    → OUTPUT: "🔄 Starting attempt [CURRENT_ATTEMPT + 1] of {{max_iterations}}..."   
    → Analyze the error from logs. In case statvar processor failed, read log file at: {{working_dir}}/.datacommons/processor.log
    {# TODO: move debugging instructions to separate section #}
    → **Common {{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_metadata.csv issues to check:**
       • Missing or wrong `header_rows` (should be 1 for standard CSV with headers)
       • Wrong `skip_rows` value skipping too much data
       • Debugging parameters left in production (`process_rows`, `input_rows`, `input_columns`)
       • Place resolution issues: missing `places_within` or wrong `place_type`
    → Modify {{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_pvmap.csv and/or {{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_metadata.csv to fix identified issues
    → INCREMENT ATTEMPT COUNTER
    → Return to Step 5 (Run the Processor)

ELSE (CURRENT_ATTEMPT >= {{max_iterations}}):
    → OUTPUT: "⛔ ITERATION LIMIT REACHED: Failed after {{max_iterations}} attempts"
    → OUTPUT: "📋 Final Status: FAILED - Manual intervention required"
    → OUTPUT: "📁 Check logs at: {{working_dir}}/.datacommons/ for debugging"
    → OUTPUT: "📁 Check backup at: {{working_dir}}/runs/{{gemini_run_id}}/ for debugging"
    → STOP EXECUTION IMMEDIATELY
    → DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE ATTEMPTS
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: You MUST follow this decision logic exactly. Do not deviate from these rules.

# INPUT DATA FOR THIS RUN

{% if dataset_type == 'sdmx' -%}
**🚨 SDMX DATASET DETECTED 🚨**

This is an SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange) dataset with rich metadata.

- Configuration location: Place all processor flags/settings in `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_metadata.csv` only. Do not embed settings in `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_pvmap.csv` and do not propose additional CLI flags.

# 🛑 FINAL EXECUTION REMINDERS

**BEFORE YOU START - REMEMBER THESE RULES:**

1. **MAXIMUM ATTEMPTS**: You have exactly {{max_iterations}} attempts
2. **TRACK YOUR ATTEMPTS**: Always output "ATTEMPT X of {{max_iterations}}" before running processor
3. **DECISION POINTS**: Follow the exact "🎯 DECISION LOGIC" section above - no exceptions
4. **SUCCESS = STOP**: If any attempt succeeds, STOP immediately
5. **FAILURE LIMIT**: If {{max_iterations}} attempts fail, STOP immediately with failure message
6. **NO INFINITE LOOPS**: The iteration control prevents endless retries

# ACTION REQUIRED NOW

**Execute** the data analysis and generate the `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_pvmap.csv` and `{{output_dir}}/{{output_basename}}_metadata.csv`
files now. Follow the primary workflow **WITHOUT** deviation.

**REMEMBER**: You have {{max_iterations}} attempts maximum. Track each attempt and stop when you succeed or reach the limit.
