# CRITICAL DIRECTIVES & CONSTRAINTS

You **MUST** adhere to these rules at all times.

## Task Management

- **ALWAYS maintain a comprehensive todo list** for the entire workflow and
  update tasks as they are completed.

## File Handling

- **NEVER alter input data or metadata files.**
- **NEVER read entire data files**, as they may exceed the context window.
- **When inspecting data files, limit reads to the first 20 lines.**
- **ALWAYS read metadata files before data files.**

## Data Processing Logic

- If the metadata contains a `<structure:Constraints>` section, you **MUST**
  use these definitions to determine which codes to map. Do not rely on
  reading the data file.
- If `<structure:Constraints>` is not present, you may sample the first 10
  lines of the data file to understand the data.

## Reusability

- **ALWAYS reuse existing Data Commons entities and conventions**

# CORE KNOWLEDGE BASE

CSV data is imported into Data Commons. The data is to be converted into
`StatisticalVariable` and `StatVarObservation`s as described in
https://docs.datacommons.org/data_model.html#statistical-variable.

## Dataset Categories for Classification

### Main Categories and subcategories

1. **Demographics** - Population, age, gender, race, ethnicity, citizenship, migration
2. **Economy** - Employment, income, poverty, business, trade, prices
3. **Health** - Disease, mortality, healthcare access, medical conditions, vaccines
4. **Education** - Enrollment, attainment, schools, teachers, students
5. **Housing** - Housing units, home values, rents, occupancy, housing conditions
6. **Environment** - Air quality, water, climate, emissions, natural disasters
7. **Energy** - Electricity, fuel, renewable energy, consumption
8. **Agriculture** - Farms, crops, livestock, food production
9. **Crime** - Crime incidents, law enforcement, incarceration
10. **Transportation** - Commute, vehicles, transport modes

## Data Commons Core Entities

A **StatisticalVariable**(also known as `StatVar`) represents a template of data attributes
and dimensions that apply to a series of observations for different places and
times. A `StatisticalVariable` should have the following **mandatory
properties**:

- `populationType`
- `measuredProperty`
- `statType`

It can have an additional set of constraint properties such as gender, age, etc.

A **StatVarObservation** (also known as `SVObs`) captures the value of the
`StatisticalVariable` for a given place and time. It has the following
**mandatory properties**:

- `observationAbout`
- `observationDate`
- `variableMeasured`
- `value`

It can have the following optional properties:

- `observationPeriod` -example: ‚ÄúP1Y‚Äù, ‚ÄúP1M‚Äù
- `unit`
- `scalingFactor`- Example: 100 for unit:Percent to indicate values are in the
  range 0-100
- `measurementMethod`- a node describing additional considerations for a
  value, such as base year for indexes and currencies, or if a value is an
  Estimate or a Projection.

## Statvar processor User Guide

- The source data is processed into `StatisticalVariable` and
  `StatVarObservation`.
- This processing is done using the `statvar_processor` script, available at:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacommonsorg/data/refs/heads/master/tools/statvar_importer/stat_var_processor.py.
- The `statvar_processor` script requires a `pvmap` config file.
- The `pvmap` config file maps strings found in source data (e.g., column
  headers and values) to `property:values` in the DataCommons schema.
- The `statvar_processor` script collects all applicable `property:values` for
  a cell by looking up the `pvmap` using:
  - The strings in the cell‚Äôs content.
  - The cell's column or row headers.
  - Substrings of these (delimited by spaces).
- All collected `property:values` are then segregated into
  `StatisticalVariable` and `StatVarObservation`.
- Any property that cannot be part of a `StatVarObservation` is added to the
  `StatisticalVariable`.

## `stat_var_processor.py` Script

The `stat_var_processor.py` script imports statistical data into Data Commons.

**Function:**

- Converts source data into `StatisticalVariable` (StatVar) and
  `StatVarObservation` (SVObs) entities.
- Processes input data files based on a set of configurations and a
  property-value map.
- Generates MCF files for StatVars and CSV/TMCF files for SVObs.

### Usage

The script is run from the command line:

```shell
python3 stat_var_processor.py --input_data=<path-to-csv-or-other-input> \
    --pv_map=<column-pv-map-file> \
    --output_path=<output-prefix> \
    --config_file=<path-to-config-file>
```

This will generate:

- `<output-prefix>_stat_vars.mcf`: MCF file with StatVar definitions
  (configurable name via `output_statvar_mcf`).
- `<output-prefix>.csv`: CSV file with StatVarObservations (configurable name
  via `output_csv`).
- `<output-prefix>.tmcf`: TMCF file mapping CSV columns to StatVar PVs
  (configurable name via `output_tmcf_file`).

### Configuration

Configuration is primarily managed through a config file (specified by
`--config_file`) and/or command-line flags. The config file can be a Python
dictionary or a JSON file

Command-line flags generally override config file settings.

#### 1. Property-Value Map (`pv_map`)

This is crucial for mapping strings from your input data to Data Commons
properties and values. It can be a Python file defining a dictionary, a JSON
file, or a CSV file

**Format Example (CSV notation):**

```csv
key,p1,v1,p2,v2
<input-string1>,<property1>,<value1>,<property2>,<value2>
Child,populationType,Person,age,[- 15 Years]
```

**Key Features and Special Properties:**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: {Data} Variable Quoting Rules ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**ALWAYS enclose {Data} in single quotes ('{Data}') when using it in:**
- **#Eval expressions**
- **#Filter expressions**  
- **#Regex patterns**

**This is because {Data} is replaced with the actual string value from your data, and without quotes, Python evaluation will fail.**

**Example of CORRECT usage:**
- `Status_Column,#Eval,"status='Active' if '{Data}' == 'Y' else 'Inactive'"`
- `Category,#Filter,"'{Data}' not in ['NA', 'N/A', 'null']"`

**Example of INCORRECT usage (will cause failures):**
- `Status_Column,#Eval,"status='Active' if {Data} == 'Y' else 'Inactive'"` ‚ùå

---

- **String Mapping**: Directly map an input string to one or more
  property-values.
  - Example: `Men,populationType,Person,gender,Male`
- **Internal Variables for Cell Values**:
  - `Data`: The raw string value in a cell
  - `Number`: The numeric value if the cell contains a number
  - `Key`: The input string that was looked up in the `pv_map`
  - Example: `Age_Column_Header,age,{Number}` (This would map
    the numeric value from cells under 'Age_Column_Header' to the `age`
    property).
- **Variable Substitution**: User-defined variables (capitalized names) can
  store intermediate values for transformation, but are not emitted in the
  output.
  - Example:

```csv
Product_Name_Column,ProductName,{Data}
Product_Code_Column,name,"Total imports of {ProductName} (code: {Data})"
```

- **`#Format`**: Use Python f-string like formatting.

  - Syntax: `'<input-key>',#Format,"<prop>=<format-expression>" }`
  - Example: `FipsCode,#Format,"observationAbout=dcs:geoId/{Number:02d}"` (Pads FIPS code to 2
    digits)

- **`#Regex`**: Use named Python regular expressions to extract parts of an
  input string.

  - Example (extracting start and end age from "20-25"):

```csv
Age-Group,#Regex,"(?P<StartAge>[0-9]+) *- *(?P<EndAge>[0-9]+)",age,[{StartAge} {EndAge} Years]
```

  - Example using {Data} in regex pattern:

```csv
Country_Name,#Regex,"(?P<Country>.*) \('{Data}'\)",countryName,{Country}
```

  **üî¥ CRITICAL: Always use '{Data}' (with single quotes) in #Regex patterns! üî¥**
  
  Note: #Regex expressions are wrapped in double quotes, and use single quotes for string literals within the expression.

- **`#Eval`**: Perform complex transformations using Python expressions.
  - Syntax: `<property>=<expression>`
  - Example (unit conversion):

```csv
Weight_Lbs,#Eval,"value={Number} * 0.453592",unit,dcs:Kilogram
```

  - Example using {Data} in eval expression:

```csv
Status_Column,#Eval,"status='Active' if '{Data}' == 'Y' else 'Inactive'",active,{status}
```

  **üî¥ CRITICAL: Always use '{Data}' (with single quotes) in #Eval expressions! üî¥**
  
  Note: #Eval expressions are wrapped in double quotes, and use single quotes for string literals within the expression.

```
(Similar format: `SomeKey,#Eval,"value={Number} * 2.205"`)
```

- **Supported Functions in Eval:**
  - `format_date(date_string, output_format_string)`: Parses and formats
    dates. Default output is YYYY-MM-DD.
    - Example: `DateColumn,#Eval,"observationDate=format_date('{Data}')"`
  - `str_to_camel_case(string_value)`: Converts a string to CamelCase.
    - Example: `ProductType,#Eval,"productEnum=str_to_camel_case('{Data}')"`
- **`#Filter`**: Conditionally drop SVObs rows. If the expression evaluates to
  `False`, the SVObs is dropped.
  - Example: `ValueColumn,value,{Number},#Filter,{Number} > 0` (Drops rows where 'ValueColumn' is not positive)
  
  - Example using {Data} in filter expression:

```csv
Category,value,{Data},#Filter,"'{Data}' not in ['NA', 'N/A', 'null', '']"
```

  **üî¥ CRITICAL: Always use '{Data}' (with single quotes) in #Filter expressions! üî¥**
- **`#ignore`**: If a cell's PV map results in an `#ignore` property, the
  corresponding SVObs may be dropped or the cell might be treated differently
  depending on context.
  - Example: `Not Applicable,#ignore,Value is not applicable`
- **`#Header`**: Marks a row as a header row or indicates specific properties
  from a cell should be treated as column headers.
  - Example: `Column A,#Header,"property1,property2=defaultValue"` This would mean if "Column A" is
    found, `property1` (value taken from cell if `property1` exists for
    "Column A" mapping) and `property2` (with `defaultValue`) become header
    PVs for that column.

---

**üö® FINAL REMINDER: {Data} Quoting Requirements üö®**

**Remember these CRITICAL rules when generating PV maps:**

1. **ALWAYS use '{Data}' (with single quotes) in #Eval, #Filter, and #Regex expressions**
2. **NEVER use bare {Data} without quotes in these expressions**  
3. **Double-check every expression before submitting**

**Quick Examples:**
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: `Category,#Filter,"'{Data}' != 'null'"`
- ‚ùå WRONG: `Category,#Filter,"{Data} != 'null'"`
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: `Name,#Eval,"fullName='{Data}'.upper()"`
- ‚ùå WRONG: `Name,#Eval,"fullName={Data}.upper()"`

---

#### 2. General Processing Settings (via `--config_file` or command-line flags)

These settings control various aspects of the data processing pipeline. Default

  this are ignored.
- `use_all_numeric_data_values` (Default: `False`): If `True`, any numeric
  value found in a cell not otherwise mapped by `pv_map` will be treated as
  `{'value': <numeric_value>}`. If `False` (default), it's treated as
  `{self._config.get('numeric_data_key', 'Number'): <numeric_value>}`.

  DCIDs.
- `schemaless_statvar_comment_undefined_pvs` (Default: `False`): If `True` and
  `schemaless` is enabled, valid DC properties that are not yet defined in the
  DC API are commented out in the StatVar MCF.
- `generate_statvar_name` (Default: `False`): If `True`, automatically
  generates a `name` for StatVars based on their properties if no name is

- `input_reference_column` (Default value is likely `__INPUT_REFERENCE__` or
  similar): Name of the column added to SVObs CSV to store the input file
  context (filename:line:column).

**Data Transformation and Processing Logic:**

- `aggregate_duplicate_svobs` (Default: `None`): If set (e.g., 'sum', 'min',
  'max', 'mean', 'list'), SVObs with the same place, date, and StatVar but
  different values will be aggregated using this method. This can also be

- `date_format_key` (Default: `'#DateFormat'`): Property name in PVs
  specifying the input date format string (strptime format) for a date value.
- `date_format`: A global input date format string if not specified per value.

  YYYY-MM, or YYYY): The target format for `observationDate` in the output.
- `filter_key` (Default: `'#Filter'`): The property key in PVs used for
  filtering SVObs via an eval expression.
- `eval_globals`: Dictionary of global functions/modules available to `#Eval`
  and `#Filter` expressions.
- `drop_statvars_without_svobs` (Default: `True`): If `True`, StatVars that
  have no corresponding SVObs generated are dropped from the output MCF.

**Place Resolution:**

- `resolve_places` (Default: `False`, but automatically set to `True` if
  certain place-related configs are provided like `maps_api_key` or

- `places_resolved_csv`: Path to a CSV file where successfully resolved places
  (name to DCID) are cached/written. This file can be reviewed and manually
  edited
- `place_type` (Flag: `--place_type`): Comma-separated list of DC place types
  (e.g., 'City', 'County') to filter resolution results.
  - Example: `{'place_type': 'AdministrativeArea1,AdministrativeArea2'}`
- `maps_api_country` / `places_within` (Flag: `--places_within`): Restrict
  place resolution to a specific country or administrative area DCID(s).
  - Example: `{'maps_api_country': 'USA'}` or `{'places_within':
'country/USA'}`
- `maps_api_administrative_area`: Further restrict place resolution by
  administrative area.

**Execution and Debugging:**

- `resume` (Flag: `--resume`, Default: `False`): If `True`, skips processing
  if output files already exist.
- `debug` (Flag: `--debug`, Default: `False`): Enables verbose logging for
  debugging. **WARNING**: Use this only in rare cases when troubleshooting specific
  issues, as it produces extensive logs that may exceed context limits and make
  output difficult to manage.
- `parallelism` (Flag: `--parallelism`, Default: `0` meaning
  `os.cpu_count()`): Number of parallel processes to use when processing
  multiple input files or sharded data. If 1, runs serially.
- `http_port` (Flag: `--http_port`): If set, launches an HTTP server on this
  port to provide a web UI for the script.
- `shard_input_by_column`: If `parallelism` \> 1, specifies a column name to
  shard the input CSV by, processing each shard in parallel.
- `shard_prefix_length`: When sharding, length of the prefix of the shard
  column value to group by.

This guide covers a comprehensive set of configurations. For the most precise
details on flags and their defaults, referring to the `config_flags.py` file
used by the script and the script's `ConfigMap` initializations would be
beneficial. The provided search result "Stat Var Processor" also serves as a
good reference for many of these options and their usage patterns.

The `stat_var_processor.py` script provides mechanisms to aggregate
`StatVarObservation` (SVObs) values when multiple observations for the same
statistical variable, place, and date are encountered. This is primarily
controlled by a global configuration option and can be overridden on a per-case
basis using a special key in the Property-Value (PV) map.

The core logic for this aggregation is handled within the `StatVarsMap` class,
specifically by the `aggregate_value` method This method supports several
aggregation types:

- `sum`: Adds the new value to the existing value.
- `min`: Takes the minimum of the existing and new values.
- `max`: Takes the maximum of the existing and new values.
- `mean`: Calculates the running mean of the values. It keeps track of the
  count of aggregated values using an internal property like
  `#Count-<aggregate_property>`.
- `list`: Appends the new value to a comma-separated list of existing values.
- `first`: Keeps the first encountered value.
- `last`: Overwrites the existing value with the new value (effectively
  keeping the last encountered).

These aggregation types are case-insensitive in the configuration
<!-- remove aggregation -->
### Configuration for Aggregation

1.  **Global Configuration (`aggregate_duplicate_svobs`):** You can set a
    default aggregation behavior in your main configuration file (e.g.,
    `metadata.csv` or via command-line flags).

```csv
# In your metadata.csv
parameter,value
aggregate_duplicate_svobs,sum
# e.g., sum, mean, min, max, etc.
# ... other configurations
```

This setting will apply to all SVObs that are duplicates (same place, date, and
StatVar) unless overridden.

1.  **Per-SVObs Override (`#Aggregate` key in PV-Map):** You can specify or
    override the aggregation method for specific StatVars or types of
    observations directly in your PV-map file. This is done using the
    `#Aggregate` key (the exact key name can be configured via `aggregate_key`,
    which defaults to `'#Aggregate'`

### Example Scenario

Let's imagine you have an input CSV file (`data.csv`) with daily sales figures
for different products, and sometimes multiple entries exist for the same
product on the same day from different cash registers.

**`data.csv`:**

```
Date,Product,Location,Sales,RegisterID
2025-05-01,Apples,Store1,50,Reg1
2025-05-01,Apples,Store1,30,Reg2
2025-05-01,Bananas,Store1,100,Reg1
2025-05-01,Bananas,Store1,110,Reg2
2025-05-02,Apples,Store1,45,Reg1
```

**Desired Aggregations:**

- For "Apples" sales, we want the total sum for the day.
- For "Bananas" sales, we want the maximum reported sale for the day (perhaps
  one register had a correction).

**`pvmap.csv`:**

```csv
key,property,value
Date,observationDate,{Data}
Location,observationAbout,{Data}
# Assuming Store1 maps to a DCID
Sales,value,{Number}
RegisterID,observationDetails,Register_{Data}
# Example, not aggregated

Apples,variableMeasured,dcid:dailySales_Apples,#Aggregate,sum
# Hypothetical StatVar DCID - Aggregate sales for Apples by summing
Bananas,variableMeasured,dcid:dailySales_Bananas,#Aggregate,max
# Hypothetical StatVar DCID - Aggregate sales for Bananas by taking the max
```

**`metadata.csv`:**

```csv
parameter,value
input_data,data.csv
pv_map,pvmap.csv
output_path,output/sales_summary
header_rows,1
# Assuming the first row is a header
<!-- TODO : remove mapped columns for sdmx -->
mapped_columns,"Product"
# For multiple columns use quotes: mapped_columns,"Product,Location,Date"
# The "Product" column determines the StatVar and aggregation
# Note: default_svobs_pvs and default_statvar_pvs contain nested properties
# and are typically handled separately in the statvar processor
# aggregate_duplicate_svobs,sum  # A global default could be set here if desired
```

**How it works:**

When processing `data.csv`:

1.  For the first row (`2025-05-01,Apples,Store1,50,Reg1`):
    - An SVObs for `dailySales_Apples` with value 50 is created.
2.  For the second row (`2025-05-01,Apples,Store1,30,Reg2`):
    - The script identifies this as a duplicate SVObs (same `observationDate`,
      `observationAbout` for `dailySales_Apples`).
    - The PVs for "Apples" specify `#Aggregate: 'sum'`.
    - The `aggregate_value` method is called. The existing value (50) and the
      new value (30) are summed, resulting in an updated SVObs value of 80 for
      `dailySales_Apples` on `2025-05-01` at `Store1`
3.  For the third row (`2025-05-01,Bananas,Store1,100,Reg1`):
    - An SVObs for `dailySales_Bananas` with value 100 is created.
4.  For the fourth row (`2025-05-01,Bananas,Store1,110,Reg2`):
    - This is a duplicate for `dailySales_Bananas`.
    - The PVs for "Bananas" specify `#Aggregate: 'max'`.
    - The `aggregate_value` method takes `max(100, 110)`, resulting in an
      updated SVObs value of 110\.

**Output SVObs (conceptual):**

After processing, the `output/sales_summary.csv` would effectively represent:

| observationDate | observationAbout | variableMeasured        | value | unit | measurementMethod        | ...  |
| :-------------- | :--------------- | :---------------------- | :---- | :--- | :----------------------- | :--- |
| 2025-05-01      | Store1           | dcid:dailySales_Apples  | 80    | USD  | dcs:DataCommonsAggregate | ...  |
| 2025-05-01      | Store1           | dcid:dailySales_Bananas | 110   | USD  | dcs:DataCommonsAggregate | ...  |
| 2025-05-02      | Store1           | dcid:dailySales_Apples  | 45    | USD  |                          | ...  |

The `measurementMethod` property of the SVObs will also be updated to indicate
that aggregation has occurred (e.g., to `dcs:DataCommonsAggregate` or
`dcs:dcAggregate/<OriginalMethod>`) If the `merged_pvs_property` (default
`#MergedSVObs`) is enabled or configured, the aggregated SVObs can also contain
references to the original SVObs that were merged

This example illustrates how you can use a combination of global settings and
specific PV-map directives to control the aggregation of SVObs values.

## ### 1. PV-Map Generation Guide

Following sections contains detailed technical specifications, examples, and
instructions for creating the `pvmap.csv` file. Use it as a reference manual
when constructing the mappings.

### Guidelines to create PV map

**Here are guidelines to create a pvmap.**

**CRITICAL GUIDELINES**

**1. Always use column name as namespace to avoid ambiguity**

When mapping column values to properties, ALWAYS qualify the value with its column name using the format `<COLUMN_NAME>:<VALUE>` to prevent conflicts when the same value appears in different columns.

**‚ùå INCORRECT (causes ambiguity):**
```csv
S1,populationType,TotalEconomy
S1,counterpartSector,TotalEconomy
```
Problem: Both mappings use "S1" - it's unclear which column each refers to.

**‚úÖ CORRECT (with column namespace):**
```csv
SECTOR:S1,populationType,TotalEconomy
COUNTERPART_SECTOR:S1,counterpartSector,TotalEconomy
```
Solution: Each value is prefixed with its column name, eliminating ambiguity.

**More Examples:**

Example 1 - Geographic codes in multiple columns:
```csv
# Incorrect:
US,originCountry,UnitedStates
US,destinationCountry,UnitedStates

# Correct:
ORIGIN:US,originCountry,UnitedStates
DESTINATION:US,destinationCountry,UnitedStates
```

Example 2 - Year values in different contexts:
```csv
# Incorrect:
2023,observationDate,2023
2023,referenceYear,2023

# Correct:
YEAR_COLUMN:2023,observationDate,2023
BASE_YEAR:2023,referenceYear,2023
```

**Why this is critical:** Without column namespacing, the import system cannot distinguish between identical values from different columns, leading to incorrect data mappings and potential data loss or corruption.

**BASIC GUIDELINES**

1.  populationType. Examples populationTypes are Person, EconomicActivity, Debt.
2.  measuredProperty. Example measuredProperty are count, amount,
3.  observationAbout. This is used for places. \
    The property observationAbout should finally contain the place dcid, such as
    geoId/\<FIPS code\> for US states and counties, eg: geoId/06 for California,
    or wikidataId/\<Q‚Ä¶\> for places with a wikidata entry. If the place name
    cannot be mapped to a place dcid easily, set it to {Data}. For example:
    State \-\> observationAbout, {Data}
4.  value. This is used for the observed value that goes into the
    StatVarObservation. Map the column header containing the numeric data values
    to value,{Number}. If the numeric observation values have a units such as a
    currency, map the source string to unit,\<Currency code\>. Example:
    unit,INR, or unit,Kilogram.
5.  observationDate. This is used for the date of the observation in the format
    YYYY or YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD. For columns that have a date, map the column
    header to observationDate,{Data}. If the columns header has a specific date,
    then set it as the observationDate. Example, if the column names '2025' have
    values for 2025, use the following pvmap for 2025:
    observationDate,2025,value,{Number}. If there is a date range, then set the
    observationDate to the end of the range and use observationPeriod to
    indicate the duration, such as P1Y to year or P3M for 3 months
6.  name: Use this property to set the name of the StatisticalVariable based on
    the source strings.
7.  Map any additional strings from the source to property,value from data
    commons schema such that the meaning of all the attributes that apply to
    data in a row or column are captured. A property in DataCommons begins with
    a lower case letter. A value in DataCommons is a reference to a node that
    begins with a Capital letter and uses CamelCase without spaces.
8.  Ensure that each key in the pvmap is unique. If there are multiple
    property,values for a single key, append them to the same row in the pvmap.
9.  If a property has no value, set it to an empty string in double quotes. For
    example, if a column has gender as strings, 'Male', 'Female', 'Total', then
    the property value 'gender,""' can be used for 'Total'.

**Here are a few guidelines to consider when generating pvmaps**:

1.  The first column in the pvmap should be a string or a substring from the
    source data csv files.
2.  The remaining columns in the pvmap are a sequence of property and value from
    data commons schema that represent that source string.
3.  The source string should appear only once in the pvmap and it can be mapped
    to one or more property values.
4.  All properties in the pvmap should be followed by a non-empty value or an
    empty string in double quotes ‚Äú‚Äù.
5.  The value of a property can be a numeric quantity range, such as ‚Äú\[10 15
    Years\]‚Äù with \[\<start\> \<end\> \<unit\>\]
6.  If a source substring delimited by spaces is repeated across multiple rows
    or column headers and it can be mapped to a property:value, then generate a
    set of property:values for the sub-string instead of repeating it.
7.  If there are dates as column headers, then generate property:value maps for
    possible future dates sing the same patterns as well.
8.  You can group pvmaps for strings from a column and add a comment string
    beginning with ‚Äò\#‚Äô before them describing the source context, such as the
    column header or column number.
9.  If there are multiple alternative candidate property:value for a source
    string, then add the best candidate with the source string and add the
    remaining ones as commented lines following the chosen one.

### Constraints

- The pvmap should have at least one source string mapped to the following
  properties:

1.  populationType. Examples populationTypes are Person, EconomicActivity, Debt.

2.  measuredProperty. Example measuredProperty are count, amount,

3.  observationAbout. Example: observationAbout: {Data}

4.  observationDate: Example: observationDate, {Data}

5.  value: Example: value, {Number}

- Check that each place does not get duplicate values for the same date.
- Add additional property:values to map such cells to a unique set of
  StatisticalVariables or unique SatVarObservations with different
  measurementMethod, unit or observationPeriod.

## SDMX-Specific Guidelines

When working with SDMX datasets, follow these additional guidelines:

### SDMX Structure Overview
**SDMX Structure Analysis**: The input metadata will contain SDMX structure definitions including:

- **Dimensions**: Used to categorize observations (e.g., TIME_PERIOD, REF_AREA, FREQ)
- **Attributes**: Provide additional context about observations
- **Measures**: The actual statistical values being observed

### SDMX Metadata Elements for Context Building

#### Key Metadata Fields
SDMX metadata provides rich semantic information through `<common:name>` and `<common:description>` elements that appear at multiple levels:

**1. Dataflow Level**
```xml
<structure:Dataflow id="WS_CBPOL">
  <common:name xml:lang="en">Central Bank Policy Rates</common:name>
  <common:description xml:lang="en">Policy interest rates set by central banks</common:description>
</structure:Dataflow>
```

**2. Codelist Level**
```xml
<structure:Codelist id="CL_FREQ">
  <common:name xml:lang="en">Frequency</common:name>
  <structure:Code id="M">
    <common:name xml:lang="en">Monthly</common:name>
    <common:description xml:lang="en">Monthly observations</common:description>
  </structure:Code>
</structure:Codelist>
```

**3. Concept Scheme Level**
```xml
<structure:ConceptScheme id="CS_COMMON">
  <structure:Concept id="FREQ">
    <common:name xml:lang="en">Frequency of observation</common:name>
    <common:description xml:lang="en">The time interval at which data is collected</common:description>
  </structure:Concept>
</structure:ConceptScheme>
```

**Note**: Multiple languages may be present (xml:lang="en", xml:lang="fr", etc.). Prioritize English when available.

#### How Metadata Links to Data Structure

**Dimension-to-Concept Linkage**:
- Dimensions reference concepts via `<structure:ConceptIdentity>`
- Each dimension inherits semantic meaning from its concept's name/description
- Codelists provide valid values with their own names/descriptions

**Example**:
```xml
<structure:Dimension id="REF_AREA">
  <structure:ConceptIdentity>
    <Ref id="REF_AREA"/>  <!-- Links to concept -->
  </structure:ConceptIdentity>
  <structure:LocalRepresentation>
    <structure:Enumeration>
      <Ref id="CL_AREA"/>  <!-- Links to codelist -->
    </structure:Enumeration>
  </structure:LocalRepresentation>
</structure:Dimension>
```

#### Additional Metadata Elements

- **`<structure:TextFormat>`**: Specifies data type (e.g., String, Decimal)
- **`<structure:Enumeration>`**: References codelists for valid values
- **`<structure:ConceptIdentity>`**: Links dimensions/attributes to concepts

#### Using Metadata for Semantic Mapping

Combine names and descriptions to understand the semantic meaning:
- Dataflow name ‚Üí helps identify the dataset's purpose
- Dimension concept names ‚Üí understand what each dimension represents
- Code names/descriptions ‚Üí map to appropriate Data Commons properties
- Attribute descriptions ‚Üí determine if observation-level or statistical variable property

### Core SDMX Mappings

#### 1. Standard Dimensions
* **REF_AREA** ‚Üí `observationAbout`
  * ISO country codes: `{Data},observationAbout,country/{Data}` -> use **country/{Data}**
  * Specific: `USA,observationAbout,country/USA`
  
* **TIME_PERIOD** ‚Üí `observationDate`
  * Annual: `{Data},observationDate,{Data}` (YYYY)
  * Quarterly: `2024-Q1,observationDate,2024-03` (use period end)
    * PV example for this conversion   TIME_PERIOD,#Regex,"^(?P<Year>[0-9]{4})-Q(?P<Quarter>[1-4])$",#Eval,"observationDate='{Year}-' + str(int({Quarter})*3).zfill(2)"
  * Monthly: `{Data},observationDate,{Data}` (YYYY-MM)

* **FREQ** ‚Üí `observationPeriod`
  * `A,observationPeriod,P1Y` (Annual)
  * `Q,observationPeriod,P3M` (Quarterly) 
  * `M,observationPeriod,P1M` (Monthly)
  * `D,observationPeriod,P1D` (Daily)
  * `W,observationPeriod,P1W` (Weekly)

* **INDICATOR/SERIES** ‚Üí `measuredProperty` and StatVar construction
  * Example: `GDP_GROWTH,measuredProperty,growthRate,populationType,EconomicActivity`

#### 2. Measures
The primary observation value in SDMX:

* **OBS_VALUE**: The observation value
  * Always map to: `OBS_VALUE,value,{Number}`
  * Or for column headers: `<value_column>,value,{Number}`

#### 3. Attributes
**IMPORTANT: SDMX attributes should only map to observation-level properties (not StatVar properties):**

* **UNIT_MEASURE**: Unit of measurement
  * Map to `unit` property with DC-compatible units
  * Examples:
    * `USD,unit,USDollar`
    * `EUR,unit,Euro`
    * `PERCENT,unit,Percent`
    * `INDEX,unit,Index`
    * `PERSONS,unit,Person`

* **UNIT_MULT**: Unit multiplier (scale factor)
  * Map to `scalingFactor` or use `#Multiply`
  * Examples:
    * `3,scalingFactor,1000` (thousands)
    * `6,scalingFactor,1000000` (millions)
    * `9,scalingFactor,1000000000` (billions)

* **OBS_STATUS**: Observation status flags
  * Handle special values:
    * `E,measurementMethod,Estimated`
    * `P,measurementMethod,Provisional`
    * `F,measurementMethod,Forecast`
    * `M,#ignore,Missing value` (for missing data)
    * `NA,#ignore,Not applicable`

* **BASE_PER**: Base period for indices
  * Map to `measurementMethod` with base year
  * Example: `2015,measurementMethod,BaseYear2015`

#### 4. Dataflow and Dataset Metadata

* **Dataflow identifier**: Use for constructing StatVar names
  * Example: `BIS:WS_CBPOL,name,"Central Bank Policy Rates {Data}"`

* **Dataset attributes**: Often found in header rows
  * Map dataset-level attributes to default PVs that apply globally

### SDMX-Specific Mapping Patterns

#### Hierarchical Codes
SDMX often uses hierarchical classification codes (e.g., NACE, ISIC, CPC):

```
# Economic activities (NACE)
A,economicActivity,Agriculture
A01,economicActivity,CropProduction

# Products (CPC)  
01,productClassification,AgricultureProducts
011,productClassification,Cereals
```

#### Multiple Indicators
```
GDP,measuredProperty,grossDomesticProduct,populationType,EconomicActivity
INFLATION,measuredProperty,inflationRate,populationType,EconomicActivity,statType,growthRate
UNEMPLOYMENT,measuredProperty,unemploymentRate,populationType,Person,employment,Unemployed
```

#### Standard Code Lists
```
# ISO 4217 Currency
USD,unit,USDollar

# ISO 3166 Country
USA,observationAbout,country/USA
```

#### Time Series Types
```
YOY,statType,growthRate,comparisonPeriod,P1Y
QOQ,statType,growthRate,comparisonPeriod,P3M
AVG,statType,meanValue
```

### Critical Processing Rules for SDMX

#### Metadata Extraction and Usage Rules

1. **Parse and Extract Metadata Fields**:
   * Extract `<common:name>` and `<common:description>` from all levels (dataflow, codelists, concepts)
   * Use these to build semantic context for better PV mapping generation
   * Store metadata in comments or use for generating descriptive StatVar names

2. **Language Priority**:
   * When multiple languages exist (xml:lang attributes), prioritize English ("en")
   * If English unavailable, select any available language consistently
   * Use `#Eval` with string manipulation if needed to handle multi-language labels

3. **Constraint-Based Code Selection**:
   * **CRITICAL**: Check for `<structure:Constraints>` in metadata FIRST
   * If constraints exist, map ONLY the code values specified in constraints (not entire codelist)
   * If no constraints, use full codelist but sample data to verify which codes actually appear
   * This optimization prevents creating unnecessary mappings and reduces processing time

4. **Semantic Context Building**:
   * Combine dataflow name + dimension names + code descriptions to generate meaningful StatVar names
   * Use concept descriptions to determine appropriate Data Commons properties
   * Example: "Central Bank Policy Rates" + "Monthly" + "Argentina" ‚Üí helps map to appropriate properties

#### Data Processing Rules

5. **Column Selection**: Specify relevant columns in metadata configuration to optimize processing:
   * Add `input_columns,"REF_AREA,TIME_PERIOD,OBS_VALUE,UNIT_MEASURE"` to focus on essential columns
   * Exclude metadata or auxiliary columns that don't contribute to StatVars

6. **Preserve Dimension Combinations**: Ensure each unique combination of dimensions maps to a distinct StatisticalVariable

7. **Handle Missing Values**: Use `#Filter` or `#ignore` for SDMX missing value codes (M, NA, ":", "-")

8. **Frequency Alignment**: When mixing frequencies, ensure proper date formatting:
   * Annual: YYYY
   * Quarterly: YYYY-MM (using last month of quarter)
   * Monthly: YYYY-MM
   * Daily: YYYY-MM-DD

9. **Version Management**: For datasets with revisions, use `measurementMethod` to indicate revision status

# CORE TASK

Your primary goal is to analyze the provided CSV data and generate a complete
and valid `pvmap.csv` and `metadata.csv` files which can be used with Statvar
processor tool to produce the final DataCommons artifacts.

# WORKFLOW & INSTRUCTIONS

## üö® CRITICAL ITERATION CONTROL üö®

**MAXIMUM ATTEMPTS ALLOWED**: {{max_iterations}}

### Iteration Rules - READ CAREFULLY:

1. **INITIALIZE**: You will start with "**ATTEMPT 1 of {{max_iterations}}**"
2. **TRACK STATE**: Before each statvar processor execution, clearly state your current attempt number
3. **DECISION LOGIC**: After each attempt:
   ```
   IF processor succeeds (exit code 0) AND output.csv passes all validation checklist items:
       ‚Üí OUTPUT: "SUCCESS: Completed on attempt X of {{max_iterations}}"
       ‚Üí STOP IMMEDIATELY - DO NOT **CONTINUE**
   
   ELIF current_attempt < {{max_iterations}}:
       ‚Üí OUTPUT: "ATTEMPT X FAILED - Starting attempt X+1 of {{max_iterations}}"
       ‚Üí Analyze error, fix PV map, increment attempt counter, retry
   
   ELSE (current_attempt >= {{max_iterations}}):
       ‚Üí OUTPUT: "‚õî ITERATION LIMIT REACHED: Failed after {{max_iterations}} attempts"
       ‚Üí OUTPUT: "Final status: FAILED - Manual intervention required"
       ‚Üí STOP IMMEDIATELY - DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE ATTEMPTS
   ```

4. **MANDATORY OUTPUTS**: You MUST clearly output your attempt number and final status
5. **HARD STOP**: When {{max_iterations}} attempts are reached, you MUST stop completely

**STRICTLY** follow this precise workflow to complete your task. ALWAYS
maintain a comprehensive todo list for the entire workflow and update tasks as
they are completed.

Follow these steps sequentially.

**1. Analyze All Inputs**

- Input files and configuration is listed in `INPUT DATA FOR THIS RUN` section
  below.
- **Carefully** examine examine **sample** input data `input_data` and metadata
  `input_metadata` files to understand the structure and content of the data.

{% if dataset_type == 'sdmx' -%}

- **SDMX Analysis**: For SDMX datasets, pay special attention to:
  - SDMX data structure definitions (DSD) in the metadata
  - Dimension definitions and their codelists
  - Attribute definitions and their usage
  - Measure definitions and their statistical concepts
  - **IMPORTANT**: Check for `<structure:Constraints>` - if present, focus ONLY on codes specified there
  - Frequency and time period specifications
  
- **Extract Semantic Context**: Refer to **"SDMX Metadata Elements for Context Building"** section:
  - Extract `<common:name>` and `<common:description>` from dataflows, codelists, and concepts
  - Use these metadata fields to understand the semantic meaning of data elements
  - Build context to help generate accurate PV mappings
  
- **Apply SDMX Rules**: Follow **"Critical Processing Rules for SDMX"** section:
  - Prioritize constraint-based code selection
  - Handle multi-language labels appropriately
  - Use metadata to generate meaningful StatVar names

  {%- endif %}

**2. Generate `pvmap.csv` and `metadata.csv`**

- Create the `pvmap.csv` file, mapping the source data columns to DataCommons properties based on your findings.
- Create the `metadata.csv` file and define the necessary `statvar_processor` configuration parameters within it.

{% if dataset_type == 'sdmx' -%}

### SDMX PV Map Validation Checklist

Before proceeding to run the processor, validate your SDMX PV map against this checklist:

- [ ] **All dimension codes are mapped** - Check `<structure:Constraints>` if present, otherwise verify all used codes from data
- [ ] **Time period format is consistent with frequency** - YYYY (annual), YYYY-MM (monthly/quarterly end), YYYY-MM-DD (daily)
- [ ] **Unit measures are DC-compatible** - Use USDollar not USD, Percent not PERCENT, Euro not EUR
- [ ] **Missing value codes are handled** - Map M, NA, ":", "-" to `#ignore`
- [ ] **Scaling factors are correctly applied** - UNIT_MULT mapped to `scalingFactor` (3‚Üí1000, 6‚Üí1000000, 9‚Üí1000000000)
- [ ] **Each dimension combination produces unique StatVars** - No duplicate place/date/variable combinations

{%- endif %}

**5. Run the Processor**

**üìã BEFORE EXECUTION**: Clearly state "**ATTEMPT [X] of {{max_iterations}}**: Running statvar processor"

- Execute the following commands to generate the final output and backup:

```bash
# Run statvar processor using dedicated script
{{script_dir}}/agentic_import/run_statvar_processor.sh \
  --python "{{python_interpreter}}" \
  --script-dir "{{script_dir}}" \
  --working-dir "{{working_dir}}" \
  --input-data "{{input_data}}" \
  --gemini-run-id "{{gemini_run_id}}"
```

**6. Validate the Output and Apply Iteration Control**

**üìä VALIDATION CHECKLIST**:
- Check the command exit code (0 = success, non-zero = failure)
- Verify that `{{working_dir}}/output/output.csv` exists and is not empty
- Confirm no duplicate entries for same place, date, and variable

**üéØ DECISION LOGIC - APPLY THIS EXACTLY**:

```
CURRENT_ATTEMPT = [Your current attempt number]

IF all items in the VALIDATION CHECKLIST above pass:
    ‚Üí OUTPUT: "‚úÖ SUCCESS: PV map generation completed successfully on attempt CURRENT_ATTEMPT of {{max_iterations}}"
    ‚Üí STOP EXECUTION IMMEDIATELY
    ‚Üí DO NOT PROCEED TO ANY OTHER STEPS

ELIF CURRENT_ATTEMPT < {{max_iterations}}:
    ‚Üí OUTPUT: "‚ùå ATTEMPT CURRENT_ATTEMPT FAILED - Error details: [describe specific error]"
    ‚Üí OUTPUT: "üîÑ Starting attempt [CURRENT_ATTEMPT + 1] of {{max_iterations}}..."   
    ‚Üí Analyze the error from logs. In case statvar procesor failed, read log file at: {{working_dir}}/.datacommons/processor.log
    ‚Üí Modify pvmap.csv and/or metadata.csv to fix identified issues
    ‚Üí INCREMENT ATTEMPT COUNTER
    ‚Üí Return to Step 5 (Run the Processor)

ELSE (CURRENT_ATTEMPT >= {{max_iterations}}):
    ‚Üí OUTPUT: "‚õî ITERATION LIMIT REACHED: Failed after {{max_iterations}} attempts"
    ‚Üí OUTPUT: "üìã Final Status: FAILED - Manual intervention required"
    ‚Üí OUTPUT: "üìÅ Check logs at: {{working_dir}}/.datacommons/ for debugging"
    ‚Üí OUTPUT: "üìÅ Check backup at: {{working_dir}}/runs/{{gemini_run_id}}/ for debugging"
    ‚Üí STOP EXECUTION IMMEDIATELY
    ‚Üí DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE ATTEMPTS
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: You MUST follow this decision logic exactly. Do not deviate from these rules.

# INPUT DATA FOR THIS RUN

{% if dataset_type == 'sdmx' -%}
**üö® SDMX DATASET DETECTED üö®**

This is an SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange) dataset with rich metadata.
CRITICAL: Follow all SDMX-specific guidelines and use metadata for semantic mapping.

{%- endif %}

```json
{
  "input_data": ["{{input_data}}"],
  "input_metadata": {{input_metadata | tojson}},
  "working_dir": "{{working_dir}}",
  "output_dir": "{{working_dir}}/output",
  "dataset_type": "{{dataset_type}}"
}
```

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS & FINAL INSTRUCTION

- Generate `pvmap.csv` and `metadata.csv`
- **Adhere to Rules:** Strictly follow all schema rules, property requirements, and formatting guidelines from the
  knowledge base.
- DO NOT deviate from the documented standards.

# üõë FINAL EXECUTION REMINDERS

**BEFORE YOU START - REMEMBER THESE RULES:**

1. **MAXIMUM ATTEMPTS**: You have exactly {{max_iterations}} attempts
2. **TRACK YOUR ATTEMPTS**: Always output "ATTEMPT X of {{max_iterations}}" before running processor
3. **DECISION POINTS**: Follow the exact "üéØ DECISION LOGIC" section above - no exceptions
4. **SUCCESS = STOP**: If any attempt succeeds, STOP immediately
5. **FAILURE LIMIT**: If {{max_iterations}} attempts fail, STOP immediately with failure message
6. **NO INFINITE LOOPS**: The iteration control prevents endless retries

# ACTION REQUIRED NOW

**Execute** the data analysis and generate the `pvmap.csv` and `metadata.csv`
files now. Follow the primary workflow **WITHOUT** deviation.

**REMEMBER**: You have {{max_iterations}} attempts maximum. Track each attempt and stop when you succeed or reach the limit.
