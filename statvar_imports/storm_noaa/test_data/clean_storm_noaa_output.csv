However, plentiful solar insolation/surface heating in the vicinity of a dryline fostered widely scattered thunderstorm development by the late afternoon. Strong instability and sufficient organizing wind shear lead to a few of these storms displaying supercellular characteristics and producing reports of large hail initially, owing to steep lapse rates and weak low-level shear (among other factors already mentioned). By the mid-evening, as low-level shear and storm-scale interactions began to increase, a few tornadoes occurred across portions of south-central into southwest Oklahoma. The most significant of these was an EF-1 tornado near the community of Hollister (Tillman County).","Frederick Municipal Airport (KFDR) observation.","CSV"

This included six significant (EF-2+) tornadoes and one violent (EF-4) tornado that struck Marietta (Love County). ||Synoptically, a slow-moving and deep mid/upper-level wave progressed across the Four Corners region during the day. At the surface, an area of low-pressure strengthened/deepened across southwest Kansas, with a trailing dryline extending near and just west of the 100th meridian through much of the day. As ascent overspread this feature, numerous (organized) severe thunderstorms developed across the WFO Norman Forecast Area, even by as early as daybreak/early morning hours. The boundary layer was characterized by strong instability and wind shear, favorable for an organized/supercell storm mode. Initial supercells across western Oklahoma produced a few reports of large hail and the first (brief) tornadoes of the event just after 10 AM. Supercell storm development continued across portions of the area, focusing along an axis from western-north Texas into north-central Oklahoma through much of the afternoon. The first significant (EF-2) tornado of the event impacted the eastern edge of Knox City (Knox County, Texas) just after 3 PM. Through the evening, a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) organized and swept across much of southern/central Oklahoma and adjacent north Texas. Numerous mesovortex-type tornadoes developed and impacted the aforementioned areas. Ahead of the main convective line, strong warm air advection, driven by an increasing (45-60 knot) low-level jet, promoted the development of pre-frontal/line supercell thunderstorms. Multiple of these storms became strongly tornadic, producing multiple strong and long-tracking tornadoes. This included an EF-2 tornado impacting the western portions of Ardmore, an EF-3 tornado making a direct impact on the historic downtown district and adjacent neighborhoods in Sulphur, an EF-3 tornado traversing western portions of Hughes County, just west of Holdenville, and an EF-4 tornado destroying a Dollar Tree distribution center and nearby large retail stores on the western side of Marietta.

In all, 32 tornadoes affected portions of the WFO Norman Forecast Area, the third most in a single day during the period of reliable record. This included six significant (EF-2+) tornadoes and one violent (EF-4) tornado that struck Marietta (Love County). ||Synoptically, a slow-moving and deep mid/upper-level wave progressed across the Four Corners region during the day. At the surface, an area of low-pressure strengthened/deepened across southwest Kansas, with a trailing dryline extending near and just west of the 100th meridian through much of the day. As ascent overspread this feature, numerous (organized) severe thunderstorms developed across the WFO Norman Forecast Area, even by as early as daybreak/early morning hours. The boundary layer was characterized by strong instability and wind shear, favorable for an organized/supercell storm mode. Initial supercells across western Oklahoma produced a few reports of large hail and the first (brief) tornadoes of the event just after 10 AM. Supercell storm development continued across portions of the area, focusing along an axis from western-north Texas into north-central Oklahoma through much of the afternoon. The first significant (EF-2) tornado of the event impacted the eastern edge of Knox City (Knox County, Texas) just after 3 PM. Through the evening, a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) organized and swept across much of southern/central Oklahoma and adjacent north Texas. Numerous mesovortex-type tornadoes developed and impacted the aforementioned areas. Ahead of the main convective line, strong warm air advection, driven by an increasing (45-60 knot) low-level jet, promoted the development of pre-frontal/line supercell thunderstorms. Multiple of these storms became strongly tornadic, producing multiple strong and long-tracking tornadoes. This included an EF-2 tornado impacting the western portions of Ardmore, an EF-3 tornado making a direct impact on the historic downtown district and adjacent neighborhoods in Sulphur, an EF-3 tornado traversing western portions of Hughes County, just west of Holdenville, and an EF-4 tornado destroying a Dollar Tree distribution center and nearby large retail stores on the western side of Marietta. The latter three tornadoes resulted in fatalities (1 in Sulphur, 2 near Holdenville and 1 in Marietta) along with additional injuries. ||Beyond severe weather outcomes, a significant flash flooding event occurred from the late evening of the 27th through mid-morning of the 28th. The corridor of highest rainfall, with observed 24-hour totals of 5-to-8 inches, occurred across portions of south-central into southeast Oklahoma, on the heels of a cluster of significant tornado impacts earlier in the evening.

Supercell storm development continued across portions of the area, focusing along an axis from western-north Texas into north-central Oklahoma through much of the afternoon. The first significant (EF-2) tornado of the event impacted the eastern edge of Knox City (Knox County, Texas) just after 3 PM. Through the evening, a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) organized and swept across much of southern/central Oklahoma and adjacent north Texas. Numerous mesovortex-type tornadoes developed and impacted the aforementioned areas. Ahead of the main convective line, strong warm air advection, driven by an increasing (45-60 knot) low-level jet, promoted the development of pre-frontal/line supercell thunderstorms. Multiple of these storms became strongly tornadic, producing multiple strong and long-tracking tornadoes. This included an EF-2 tornado impacting the western portions of Ardmore, an EF-3 tornado making a direct impact on the historic downtown district and adjacent neighborhoods in Sulphur, an EF-3 tornado traversing western portions of Hughes County, just west of Holdenville, and an EF-4 tornado destroying a Dollar Tree distribution center and nearby large retail stores on the western side of Marietta. The latter three tornadoes resulted in fatalities (1 in Sulphur, 2 near Holdenville and 1 in Marietta) along with additional injuries. ||Beyond severe weather outcomes, a significant flash flooding event occurred from the late evening of the 27th through mid-morning of the 28th. The corridor of highest rainfall, with observed 24-hour totals of 5-to-8 inches, occurred across portions of south-central into southeast Oklahoma, on the heels of a cluster of significant tornado impacts earlier in the evening. Additional flooding occurred across far northern Oklahoma (Kay County) during the evening of the 27th.","This tornado moved across north Norman from near 24th Avenue Northwest and Robinson Street to just southwest of 12th Avenue Northeast and Tecumseh Road. A gas station canopy and trees were damaged at the beginning of the path along 24th Avenue Northwest. The tornado then moved northeast onto the University of Oklahoma Max Westheimer Airport damaging a hangar, and then continued north producing scattered tree damage.","CSV"

The synoptic pattern across the western half of the Continental United States favored a significant severe weather episode across the region, with a powerful (110-120 knot) upper-level jet streak ejecting across the Central Plains during the evening of the 6th. In concert with robust kinematics in place, extreme instability (pockets of >4000-5000 J/kg of CAPE) promoted an environment favorable for significant severe weather. As such, the Storm Prediction Center issued a rare 'High Risk' of severe weather for portions of central and northern Oklahoma, the first to include portions of the WFO Norman Forecast Area since 20 May 2019. ||Initial supercell thunderstorms developed in the late afternoon off an accelerating dryline/Pacific front near the 100th meridian. These initial supercell thunderstorms produced large to very large hail and damaging wind gusts, though failed to undergo tornadogenesis. This may have been due to the propensity for rapid and strong downdraft surges in the vicinity of low-level mesocyclones (among other factors). With time, as storms matured and moved into an environment characterized by richer low-level moisture, and as low-level flow increased, multiple tornado occurrences did result. Additional supercell thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters developed by the late evening of the 6th across west-central into central Oklahoma. A particularly impactful cluster moved across the southern Oklahoma City Metropolitan area, producing numerous reports of significant thunderstorm wind damage (and gusts) and two weak tornadoes.","MPing report.","CSV"

This included six significant (EF-2+) tornadoes and one violent (EF-4) tornado that struck Marietta (Love County). ||Synoptically, a slow-moving and deep mid/upper-level wave progressed across the Four Corners region during the day. At the surface, an area of low-pressure strengthened/deepened across southwest Kansas, with a trailing dryline extending near and just west of the 100th meridian through much of the day. As ascent overspread this feature, numerous (organized) severe thunderstorms developed across the WFO Norman Forecast Area, even by as early as daybreak/early morning hours. The boundary layer was characterized by strong instability and wind shear, favorable for an organized/supercell storm mode. Initial supercells across western Oklahoma produced a few reports of large hail and the first (brief) tornadoes of the event just after 10 AM. Supercell storm development continued across portions of the area, focusing along an axis from western-north Texas into north-central Oklahoma through much of the afternoon. The first significant (EF-2) tornado of the event impacted the eastern edge of Knox City (Knox County, Texas) just after 3 PM. Through the evening, a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) organized and swept across much of southern/central Oklahoma and adjacent north Texas. Numerous mesovortex-type tornadoes developed and impacted the aforementioned areas. Ahead of the main convective line, strong warm air advection, driven by an increasing (45-60 knot) low-level jet, promoted the development of pre-frontal/line supercell thunderstorms. Multiple of these storms became strongly tornadic, producing multiple strong and long-tracking tornadoes. This included an EF-2 tornado impacting the western portions of Ardmore, an EF-3 tornado making a direct impact on the historic downtown district and adjacent neighborhoods in Sulphur, an EF-3 tornado traversing western portions of Hughes County, just west of Holdenville, and an EF-4 tornado destroying a Dollar Tree distribution center and nearby large retail stores on the western side of Marietta. The latter three tornadoes resulted in fatalities (1 in Sulphur, 2 near Holdenville and 1 in Marietta) along with additional injuries. ||Beyond severe weather outcomes, a significant flash flooding event occurred from the late evening of the 27th through mid-morning of the 28th. The corridor of highest rainfall, with observed 24-hour totals of 5-to-8 inches, occurred across portions of south-central into southeast Oklahoma, on the heels of a cluster of significant tornado impacts earlier in the evening.

The front reversed course and began lifting as a warm front in the morning. Though convective organization was mainly in Western Kentucky at first, late morning storms near the Missouri/Illinois border produced a brief EF-0 tornado northeast of Cape Girardeau.

On the synoptic scale, a shortwave trough centered in the middle of the country with a 60 kt mid-level jet moved across northern Arkansas. A weak surface low was moving into SE Missouri during the morning with a secondary low located further northwest. A warm frontal boundary was draped across our area. A bowing line progressed east across SE Missouri into W Kentucky and far S Illinois between 0500-1000CST, followed by a mostly sub-severe second line that exited the region by 1300CST. The environment recovered producing fuel for more severe storms, starting with supercells 1800-2100CST with a line of storms moving east-southeastward across the entire Quad State after 1900CST, crossing through by midnight. Across the Quad State, this event produced the record for most tornado track miles in a single day in office history, along with the second most warnings issued in a day (just behind the May 8, 2024 event). Widespread straight-line wind and tornado damage resulted in over 100,000 customers without power across the Quad State.||For the morning, MLCAPE values at 0700CST were 1000-2000 J/kg in W Kentucky. Effective bulk shear was 30-40 kts with STP around 1, which increased in the following hours. Precipitable water was 1.5-1.8 inches, allowing for torrential rainfall rates.||The morning round of storms produced widespread destructive straight-line wind damage leading to numerous power outages across the southernmost portions of W Kentucky from the Jackson Purchase Area to the Southern Pennyrile. Two EF-1 tornadoes occurred in Calloway County, with one of them tracking 22 miles. One person was injured when thunderstorm winds caused a tree to fall on his vehicle on Rockwood Rd in Calloway County. Two more tornadoes formed in Trigg County, one an EF-1, and an EF-2 that produced its strongest damage south of Hopkinsville in Christian County. Another EF-1 tornado formed northwest of Bremen and tracked northeastward to Island in McLean County. Torrential rainfall rates led to a few reports of flash flooding in Western Kentucky during the morning to early afternoon hours. ||Heading into the evening, MLCAPE values at 1800CST were 2000-3500 J/kg in W Kentucky. For W Kentucky, effective bulk shear rose to 45-55 kts, with SRH around 200-400 m2/s2 and STP of 2-4. 0-1 km shear was 20-30 kts. Mid-level lapse rates were 7-7.5 C/km. DCAPE of 1100-1400 J/kg provided ample opportunity for downburst winds.||Late afternoon to early evening supercells produced hail reports and a long-track EF-3 tornado that began in Lyon County, then continued east-northeastward through Caldwell and Hopkins Counties. Severe structural damage occurred between Dawson Springs and Charleston and at least one family in Barnsley lost their home for the second time with the previous instance being the historic December 10, 2021 tornado. 21 people were injured (4 in Caldwell, 17 in Hopkins) while two people lost their lives, one in Hopkins County from the tornado (48f, direct), and one in Caldwell County due to a heart attack while cleaning up tornado debris (54m, indirect). The cold front swept through, producing more straight-line wind damage and flash flooding. As the line caught up to the supercell tornado, the storm became much more muddled, with an EF-1 tornado taking shape in Muhlenberg County tracking southeastward through Beech Creek and Beechmont, and continuing as a long track tornado reaching areas north of Bowling Green. Late night power outages were widespread along the tornado tracks in Lyon, Hopkins, Caldwell, and Muhlenberg Counties, which other counties with around half the county without power included Calloway, Trigg, Christian, and Todd Counties. Rainfall amounts of 2.5 to 4 inches were commonplace, with locally higher totals in southern Trigg and Christian Counties. Brief minor flooding occurred for the third time this month on part of the S. Fork Little River near Hopkinsville.","Hail estimated to quarter size was observed north of Calvert City as a supercell affected far northern Marshall County.","CSV"

On the synoptic scale, a shortwave trough centered in the middle of the country with a 60 kt mid-level jet moved across northern Arkansas. A weak surface low was moving into SE Missouri during the morning with a secondary low located further northwest. A warm frontal boundary was draped across our area. A bowing line progressed east across SE Missouri into W Kentucky and far S Illinois between 0500-1000CST, followed by a mostly sub-severe second line that exited the region by 1300CST. The environment recovered producing fuel for more severe storms, starting with supercells 1800-2100CST with a line of storms moving east-southeastward across the entire Quad State after 1900CST, crossing through by midnight. Across the Quad State, this event produced the record for most tornado track miles in a single day in office history, along with the second most warnings issued in a day (just behind the May 8, 2024 event). Widespread straight-line wind and tornado damage resulted in over 100,000 customers without power across the Quad State.||For the morning, MLCAPE values at 0700CST were 1000-2000 J/kg in W Kentucky. Effective bulk shear was 30-40 kts with STP around 1, which increased in the following hours. Precipitable water was 1.5-1.8 inches, allowing for torrential rainfall rates.||The morning round of storms produced widespread destructive straight-line wind damage leading to numerous power outages across the southernmost portions of W Kentucky from the Jackson Purchase Area to the Southern Pennyrile. Two EF-1 tornadoes occurred in Calloway County, with one of them tracking 22 miles. One person was injured when thunderstorm winds caused a tree to fall on his vehicle on Rockwood Rd in Calloway County. Two more tornadoes formed in Trigg County, one an EF-1, and an EF-2 that produced its strongest damage south of Hopkinsville in Christian County. Another EF-1 tornado formed northwest of Bremen and tracked northeastward to Island in McLean County. Torrential rainfall rates led to a few reports of flash flooding in Western Kentucky during the morning to early afternoon hours. ||Heading into the evening, MLCAPE values at 1800CST were 2000-3500 J/kg in W Kentucky. For W Kentucky, effective bulk shear rose to 45-55 kts, with SRH around 200-400 m2/s2 and STP of 2-4. 0-1 km shear was 20-30 kts. Mid-level lapse rates were 7-7.5 C/km. DCAPE of 1100-1400 J/kg provided ample opportunity for downburst winds.||Late afternoon to early evening supercells produced hail reports and a long-track EF-3 tornado that began in Lyon County, then continued east-northeastward through Caldwell and Hopkins Counties. Severe structural damage occurred between Dawson Springs and Charleston and at least one family in Barnsley lost their home for the second time with the previous instance being the historic December 10, 2021 tornado. 21 people were injured (4 in Caldwell, 17 in Hopkins) while two people lost their lives, one in Hopkins County from the tornado (48f, direct), and one in Caldwell County due to a heart attack while cleaning up tornado debris (54m, indirect). The cold front swept through, producing more straight-line wind damage and flash flooding. As the line caught up to the supercell tornado, the storm became much more muddled, with an EF-1 tornado taking shape in Muhlenberg County tracking southeastward through Beech Creek and Beechmont, and continuing as a long track tornado reaching areas north of Bowling Green. Late night power outages were widespread along the tornado tracks in Lyon, Hopkins, Caldwell, and Muhlenberg Counties, which other counties with around half the county without power included Calloway, Trigg, Christian, and Todd Counties.

One brief EF-0 tornado also occurred in DeKalb County.||Heavy rainfall from thunderstorms repeatedly moving across portions of North Central and Northwestern Madison County resulted in flash flooding and water rescues. People drove their cars into the water in the wee hours of the morning, resulting in stalled vehicles and emergency services needed to assist people back to dry land. Later that morning, runoff from the heavy rainfall caused area creeks to swell and impact nearby roads and residential areas in further downstream on Indian Creek tributaries.","Trees were knocked down with road blockage near Mt.

That night, this trough ejected out into the central and northern Great Plains. At the surface, a low-pressure developed in western South Dakota. Extending south and southwest of this surface low into Colorado was a cold front. A secondary low-pressure center was noted in northwestern Kansas where the surface cold front intersected a dry line that extended south into western Texas. |Shortly after midnight, a line of severe thunderstorms along this cold front moved into the OAX CWA. From 05 UTC through 10 UTC, this line of storms brought widespread severe wind gusts up to 110 miles per hour and 17 spin-up tornadoes across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. These storms continued to be severe and tornadic through the morning of the 24th, later being classified as a derecho. |Troughing over the western CONUS continued to bring southwesterly flow aloft the region even behind this first trough. By the evening of the 25th, another shortwave trough had amplified over the Great Basin and had shifted over the Rocky Mountains. Ahead of this disturbance, a low-pressure developed in northwest Kansas, with a warm front extending east-southeast across northern and eastern Kansas. The evening of the 25th, scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developed across this frontal zone in northern Kansas and generally tracked to the east-northeast. As such, scattered thunderstorms moved into southeast Nebraska after 9 PM CDT. While largely remaining below severe limits, severe straight-line winds were observed along the south and east side of the Omaha metro as a thunderstorm tracked from western Otoe into eastern Pottawattamie County.

The tornado collapsed an electrical transmission line tower just west of the Lincoln County line south of Hunsucker Lane. The tornado continued northeast across multiple roads through northwest Lincoln County and damaged trees, power lines, and homes. It dissipated just north of Pleasant Ridge Road.

This EF1 tornado began just south of Route 18 east of Passaic. Some of the worst damage of the tornado affected a farm property, where one outbuilding collapsed, another had a garage door blown off, and multiple trees were damaged or uprooted. Large debris from the damaged property was blown well northeast, in some cases over 100 yards. The tornado tracked northeast, damaging a grove of trees to the south of SH 18 and producing minor damage to an outbuilding and mobile home on the north side of the highway. The tornado then tracked northeast to Route T, producing sporadic tree damage and some minor property damage. The damage track continues east-northeast along County Road 13004, with continued sporadic tree damage. One of the larger trees fell onto a residence, damaging the property as well as to power lines. Intermittent tree damage continues northeast to Route BB and County Road 13003, with more significant tree damage eastward along Sunset Drive just west of the Henry County line. Damage becomes more intermittent eastward into Henry County, with no damage observed a half mile past the county line.

As the evening progressed, strong warm air advection ahead of the mature low-pressure pushed the warm front north into eastern Nebraska by 00 UTC. ||Along this warm front and ahead of the Pacific cold front, several lines of strong to severe thunderstorms moved through eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. The first line of strong storms moved through central and northeast Nebraska after 4:30 PM CDT. No severe reports were associated with these storms in the OAX CWA. Another intensifying segment of the same line moved into southeast Nebraska by 7:30 PM CDT, this time south of the northward advancing warm front. These storms tracked northeast through southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa, producing numerous severe wind gusts across the area and multiple spin-up tornadoes. The vast majority of wind gusts recorded with these storms ranged from 55 to 70 miles per hour. The strongest wind gust was measured at 71 miles per hour in Richardson County. 2 EF-0 tornadoes were confirmed in southeast Nebraska, both in Gage County.

Most of the Kern County Mountains and Deserts picked up 1 to 2 tenths of an inch of rainfall. In addition to the precipitation, strong winds also accompanied this system and combined with the snow to produce near blizzard conditions over the Sierra Nevada north of Kings Canyon between the morning of March 1 and the morning of March 3. Scattered thunderstorms also broke out during the afternoons of March 1 and March 2 over parts of the San Joaquin Valley.

The trough then slowly moved east across the Pacific Northwest on March 2 and 3 before moving east of the region on March 4. This system brought moderate to heavy precipitation to the Sierra Nevada which picked up between 2 and 4 inches of liquid precipitation north of Kings Canyon and 1 to 2 inches further south. The precipitation fell as snow above 5000 feet for the duration of the event and produced 2 to 4 feet on new snowfall north of Kings Canyon and 1.5 to 3 feet of snow further south. This system also produced a half inch to an inch of rainfall in Merced County and a quarter to half inch across most of the remainder of the San Joaquin Valley. Most of the Kern County Mountains and Deserts picked up 1 to 2 tenths of an inch of rainfall. In addition to the precipitation, strong winds also accompanied this system and combined with the snow to produce near blizzard conditions over the Sierra Nevada north of Kings Canyon between the morning of March 1 and the morning of March 3. Scattered thunderstorms also broke out during the afternoons of March 1 and March 2 over parts of the San Joaquin Valley. While the thunderstorms were not heavy rain producers, several funnel clouds were observed and one cell produced a weak tornado in northeast Madera during the afternoon of March 1. In addition to the precipitation, several stations in the Kern County Mountains and Deserts measured wind gusts exceeding 45 mph between the evening of March 2 and the early morning of March 4.","A funnel cloud which had been previously reported by a trained spotter spawned a small tornado in northeast Madera which was on the ground for around 5 minutes and moved eastward around a half mile.

Extending south out of these pressure centers was a Pacific cold front. At 21 UTC, a warm front was noted to extend southeast from southwest Nebraska into northeast Oklahoma. As the evening progressed, strong warm air advection ahead of the mature low-pressure pushed the warm front north into eastern Nebraska by 00 UTC. ||Along this warm front and ahead of the Pacific cold front, several lines of strong to severe thunderstorms moved through eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. The first line of strong storms moved through central and northeast Nebraska after 4:30 PM CDT. No severe reports were associated with these storms in the OAX CWA. Another intensifying segment of the same line moved into southeast Nebraska by 7:30 PM CDT, this time south of the northward advancing warm front. These storms tracked northeast through southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa, producing numerous severe wind gusts across the area and multiple spin-up tornadoes. The vast majority of wind gusts recorded with these storms ranged from 55 to 70 miles per hour. The strongest wind gust was measured at 71 miles per hour in Richardson County. 2 EF-0 tornadoes were confirmed in southeast Nebraska, both in Gage County. There were also an additional 3 tornadoes confirmed in southwest Iowa, all EF-1 tornadoes.","A 58 miles per hour wind gust was measured by a personal weather station.","CSV"

At the surface, a low-pressure center was deepening over the northern High Plains along with a secondary surface low in western Nebraska. Extending south out of these pressure centers was a Pacific cold front. At 21 UTC, a warm front was noted to extend southeast from southwest Nebraska into northeast Oklahoma. As the evening progressed, strong warm air advection ahead of the mature low-pressure pushed the warm front north into eastern Nebraska by 00 UTC. ||Along this warm front and ahead of the Pacific cold front, several lines of strong to severe thunderstorms moved through eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. The first line of strong storms moved through central and northeast Nebraska after 4:30 PM CDT. No severe reports were associated with these storms in the OAX CWA. Another intensifying segment of the same line moved into southeast Nebraska by 7:30 PM CDT, this time south of the northward advancing warm front. These storms tracked northeast through southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa, producing numerous severe wind gusts across the area and multiple spin-up tornadoes. The vast majority of wind gusts recorded with these storms ranged from 55 to 70 miles per hour. The strongest wind gust was measured at 71 miles per hour in Richardson County. 2 EF-0 tornadoes were confirmed in southeast Nebraska, both in Gage County. There were also an additional 3 tornadoes confirmed in southwest Iowa, all EF-1 tornadoes.","A 64 miles per hour wind gust was measured by a personal weather station.","CSV"

The trough then slowly moved east across the Pacific Northwest on March 2 and 3 before moving east of the region on March 4. This system brought moderate to heavy precipitation to the Sierra Nevada which picked up between 2 and 4 inches of liquid precipitation north of Kings Canyon and 1 to 2 inches further south. The precipitation fell as snow above 5000 feet for the duration of the event and produced 2 to 4 feet on new snowfall north of Kings Canyon and 1.5 to 3 feet of snow further south. This system also produced a half inch to an inch of rainfall in Merced County and a quarter to half inch across most of the remainder of the San Joaquin Valley. Most of the Kern County Mountains and Deserts picked up 1 to 2 tenths of an inch of rainfall. In addition to the precipitation, strong winds also accompanied this system and combined with the snow to produce near blizzard conditions over the Sierra Nevada north of Kings Canyon between the morning of March 1 and the morning of March 3. Scattered thunderstorms also broke out during the afternoons of March 1 and March 2 over parts of the San Joaquin Valley. While the thunderstorms were not heavy rain producers, several funnel clouds were observed and one cell produced a weak tornado in northeast Madera during the afternoon of March 1. In addition to the precipitation, several stations in the Kern County Mountains and Deserts measured wind gusts exceeding 45 mph between the evening of March 2 and the early morning of March 4.","Picture of a funnel cloud near Pixley posted on Facebook.","CSV"

Extending south out of these pressure centers was a Pacific cold front. At 21 UTC, a warm front was noted to extend southeast from southwest Nebraska into northeast Oklahoma. As the evening progressed, strong warm air advection ahead of the mature low-pressure pushed the warm front north into eastern Nebraska by 00 UTC. ||Along this warm front and ahead of the Pacific cold front, several lines of strong to severe thunderstorms moved through eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. The first line of strong storms moved through central and northeast Nebraska after 4:30 PM CDT. No severe reports were associated with these storms in the OAX CWA. Another intensifying segment of the same line moved into southeast Nebraska by 7:30 PM CDT, this time south of the northward advancing warm front. These storms tracked northeast through southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa, producing numerous severe wind gusts across the area and multiple spin-up tornadoes. The vast majority of wind gusts recorded with these storms ranged from 55 to 70 miles per hour. The strongest wind gust was measured at 71 miles per hour in Richardson County. 2 EF-0 tornadoes were confirmed in southeast Nebraska, both in Gage County.

Extending south out of these pressure centers was a Pacific cold front. At 21 UTC, a warm front was noted to extend southeast from southwest Nebraska into northeast Oklahoma. As the evening progressed, strong warm air advection ahead of the mature low-pressure pushed the warm front north into eastern Nebraska by 00 UTC. ||Along this warm front and ahead of the Pacific cold front, several lines of strong to severe thunderstorms moved through eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. The first line of strong storms moved through central and northeast Nebraska after 4:30 PM CDT. No severe reports were associated with these storms in the OAX CWA. Another intensifying segment of the same line moved into southeast Nebraska by 7:30 PM CDT, this time south of the northward advancing warm front. These storms tracked northeast through southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa, producing numerous severe wind gusts across the area and multiple spin-up tornadoes. The vast majority of wind gusts recorded with these storms ranged from 55 to 70 miles per hour.

At the surface, a low-pressure center was deepening over the northern High Plains along with a secondary surface low in western Nebraska. Extending south out of these pressure centers was a Pacific cold front. At 21 UTC, a warm front was noted to extend southeast from southwest Nebraska into northeast Oklahoma. As the evening progressed, strong warm air advection ahead of the mature low-pressure pushed the warm front north into eastern Nebraska by 00 UTC. ||Along this warm front and ahead of the Pacific cold front, several lines of strong to severe thunderstorms moved through eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. The first line of strong storms moved through central and northeast Nebraska after 4:30 PM CDT. No severe reports were associated with these storms in the OAX CWA. Another intensifying segment of the same line moved into southeast Nebraska by 7:30 PM CDT, this time south of the northward advancing warm front. These storms tracked northeast through southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa, producing numerous severe wind gusts across the area and multiple spin-up tornadoes. The vast majority of wind gusts recorded with these storms ranged from 55 to 70 miles per hour. The strongest wind gust was measured at 71 miles per hour in Richardson County. 2 EF-0 tornadoes were confirmed in southeast Nebraska, both in Gage County. There were also an additional 3 tornadoes confirmed in southwest Iowa, all EF-1 tornadoes.","A 58 miles per hour wind gust was measured by a personal weather station.","CSV"

At the surface, a low-pressure center was deepening over the northern High Plains along with a secondary surface low in western Nebraska. Extending south out of these pressure centers was a Pacific cold front. At 21 UTC, a warm front was noted to extend southeast from southwest Nebraska into northeast Oklahoma. As the evening progressed, strong warm air advection ahead of the mature low-pressure pushed the warm front north into eastern Nebraska by 00 UTC. ||Along this warm front and ahead of the Pacific cold front, several lines of strong to severe thunderstorms moved through eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. The first line of strong storms moved through central and northeast Nebraska after 4:30 PM CDT. No severe reports were associated with these storms in the OAX CWA. Another intensifying segment of the same line moved into southeast Nebraska by 7:30 PM CDT, this time south of the northward advancing warm front. These storms tracked northeast through southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa, producing numerous severe wind gusts across the area and multiple spin-up tornadoes. The vast majority of wind gusts recorded with these storms ranged from 55 to 70 miles per hour. The strongest wind gust was measured at 71 miles per hour in Richardson County. 2 EF-0 tornadoes were confirmed in southeast Nebraska, both in Gage County.

While largely remaining below severe limits, a downburst did result in damage to a warehouse in Lincoln that afternoon. More widespread thunderstorms developed along the stalled frontal boundary the afternoon of the 31st, with numerous reports of funnel clouds across northeast Nebraska.

Extending south out of these pressure centers was a Pacific cold front. At 21 UTC, a warm front was noted to extend southeast from southwest Nebraska into northeast Oklahoma. As the evening progressed, strong warm air advection ahead of the mature low-pressure pushed the warm front north into eastern Nebraska by 00 UTC. ||Along this warm front and ahead of the Pacific cold front, several lines of strong to severe thunderstorms moved through eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. The first line of strong storms moved through central and northeast Nebraska after 4:30 PM CDT. No severe reports were associated with these storms in the OAX CWA. Another intensifying segment of the same line moved into southeast Nebraska by 7:30 PM CDT, this time south of the northward advancing warm front. These storms tracked northeast through southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa, producing numerous severe wind gusts across the area and multiple spin-up tornadoes. The vast majority of wind gusts recorded with these storms ranged from 55 to 70 miles per hour. The strongest wind gust was measured at 71 miles per hour in Richardson County. 2 EF-0 tornadoes were confirmed in southeast Nebraska, both in Gage County.

Extending south out of these pressure centers was a Pacific cold front. At 21 UTC, a warm front was noted to extend southeast from southwest Nebraska into northeast Oklahoma. As the evening progressed, strong warm air advection ahead of the mature low-pressure pushed the warm front north into eastern Nebraska by 00 UTC. ||Along this warm front and ahead of the Pacific cold front, several lines of strong to severe thunderstorms moved through eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. The first line of strong storms moved through central and northeast Nebraska after 4:30 PM CDT. No severe reports were associated with these storms in the OAX CWA. Another intensifying segment of the same line moved into southeast Nebraska by 7:30 PM CDT, this time south of the northward advancing warm front. These storms tracked northeast through southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa, producing numerous severe wind gusts across the area and multiple spin-up tornadoes. The vast majority of wind gusts recorded with these storms ranged from 55 to 70 miles per hour. The strongest wind gust was measured at 71 miles per hour in Richardson County. 2 EF-0 tornadoes were confirmed in southeast Nebraska, both in Gage County.

Much of the San Joaquin Valley and West Side Hills picked up between a half inch and an inch of rainfall. The Sierra Nevada and adjacent foothills generally picked up between an inch and 2 inches of liquid precipitation with several SNOTELS picking up an estimated 12 to 20 inches of new snowfall. Between a quarter and a half of an inch of rain fell across most of the Tehachapi Mountain range while the Kern County Deserts generally had less than a quarter inch of rainfall. Scattered thunderstorm broke out over the San Joaquin Valley  by late morning on January 19 and continued through late afternoon. Several of the  thunderstorms produced heavy rainfall and small hail. There were also several reports of roadway flooding in the Visalia area.

The impetus for convective development was a trailing cold front, extending from a departing system across the Great Lakes. The combination of solar insolation beneath cold temperatures aloft yielded strong instability, and with strong magnitudes of organizing wind shear, fostered development of numerous supercell thunderstorms. While wind shear over deep layers was quite strong, low-level wind shear was rather weak, promoting a favorable environment for large hail production.

That night, this trough ejected out into the central and northern Great Plains. At the surface, a low-pressure developed in western South Dakota. Extending south and southwest of this surface low into Colorado was a cold front. A secondary low-pressure center was noted in northwestern Kansas where the surface cold front intersected a dry line that extended south into western Texas. |Shortly after midnight, a line of severe thunderstorms along this cold front moved into the OAX CWA. From 05 UTC through 10 UTC, this line of storms brought widespread severe wind gusts up to 110 miles per hour and 17 spin-up tornadoes across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. These storms continued to be severe and tornadic through the morning of the 24th, later being classified as a derecho. |Troughing over the western CONUS continued to bring southwesterly flow aloft the region even behind this first trough. By the evening of the 25th, another shortwave trough had amplified over the Great Basin and had shifted over the Rocky Mountains. Ahead of this disturbance, a low-pressure developed in northwest Kansas, with a warm front extending east-southeast across northern and eastern Kansas. The evening of the 25th, scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developed across this frontal zone in northern Kansas and generally tracked to the east-northeast. As such, scattered thunderstorms moved into southeast Nebraska after 9 PM CDT. While largely remaining below severe limits, severe straight-line winds were observed along the south and east side of the Omaha metro as a thunderstorm tracked from western Otoe into eastern Pottawattamie County.

A few specific reports featured: golf ball size stones in extreme southwestern Rooks County; quarter to ping pong ball size hail in the Zurich/Plainville vicinity and also the Natoma area. Following the departure of the main round of convection, a wake low developed along the backside of the trailing stratiform rain shield, prompting a period of strong to marginally-severe winds that affected primarily Smith, Osborne and Jewell counties between 12-2 a.m. CDT on the 14th. In fact, Smith Center Municipal Airport registered a roughly 90-minute period of sustained winds at least 30-40 MPH and gusts 50-60 MPH, including a peak gust of 62 MPH...prompting some area power outages. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing, and starting with the big picture in the mid-upper levels, strengthening west-southwesterly flow and upper level divergence overspread the Central Plains, downstream from a larger-scale low digging southward through the western United States. At the surface, North Central Kansas resided along (but mainly just north) of a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented warm front, attendant to a roughly 999 millibar low pressure center that tracked from west central to northeast Kansas during the evening. Given that the warm front resided mainly just south of the local area, truly surface-based instability was held in check (as evidenced by surface dewpoints only peaking in the upper 40s-low 50s F). However, slightly elevated, most-unstable CAPE of at least 1000 J/kg nosed into the southern reaches of the area, accompanied by moderately strong deep-layer wind shear of 35-45 knots. As forcing increased along the low-level frontal zone early in the evening, storms first initiated barely south of North Central Kansas over Trego/Ellis counties between 5-6 p.m. CDT. Then, between 6-9 p.m. CDT, the initial storms morphed into a slow-moving, severe storm cluster that trudged across mainly southern Rooks County into southwestern Osborne County, yielding the various hail reports along the way. Over the next few hours this storm cluster picked up eastward momentum, while slowly weakening and becoming a bit more linear in nature, although thunderstorm wind gusts as detected by various mesonets remained slightly sub-severe before the main round of convection departed the local area out of Mitchell County between 11-11:30 p.m. CDT. Shortly thereafter, the aforementioned wake low winds took center stage within North Central Kansas, but by 2 a.m. CDT the back edge of lingering stratiform rain also departed the area to the north-northeast, ending this concern as well. Following a lull for a few hours, one last gasp of overnight convection occurred between 4:30-5:30 a.m. CDT as another, weaker storm cluster with perhaps small hail traversed mainly Mitchell County before vacating eastward.","","CSV"

A few specific reports featured: golf ball size stones in extreme southwestern Rooks County; quarter to ping pong ball size hail in the Zurich/Plainville vicinity and also the Natoma area. Following the departure of the main round of convection, a wake low developed along the backside of the trailing stratiform rain shield, prompting a period of strong to marginally-severe winds that affected primarily Smith, Osborne and Jewell counties between 12-2 a.m. CDT on the 14th. In fact, Smith Center Municipal Airport registered a roughly 90-minute period of sustained winds at least 30-40 MPH and gusts 50-60 MPH, including a peak gust of 62 MPH...prompting some area power outages. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing, and starting with the big picture in the mid-upper levels, strengthening west-southwesterly flow and upper level divergence overspread the Central Plains, downstream from a larger-scale low digging southward through the western United States. At the surface, North Central Kansas resided along (but mainly just north) of a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented warm front, attendant to a roughly 999 millibar low pressure center that tracked from west central to northeast Kansas during the evening. Given that the warm front resided mainly just south of the local area, truly surface-based instability was held in check (as evidenced by surface dewpoints only peaking in the upper 40s-low 50s F). However, slightly elevated, most-unstable CAPE of at least 1000 J/kg nosed into the southern reaches of the area, accompanied by moderately strong deep-layer wind shear of 35-45 knots. As forcing increased along the low-level frontal zone early in the evening, storms first initiated barely south of North Central Kansas over Trego/Ellis counties between 5-6 p.m. CDT. Then, between 6-9 p.m. CDT, the initial storms morphed into a slow-moving, severe storm cluster that trudged across mainly southern Rooks County into southwestern Osborne County, yielding the various hail reports along the way. Over the next few hours this storm cluster picked up eastward momentum, while slowly weakening and becoming a bit more linear in nature, although thunderstorm wind gusts as detected by various mesonets remained slightly sub-severe before the main round of convection departed the local area out of Mitchell County between 11-11:30 p.m. CDT. Shortly thereafter, the aforementioned wake low winds took center stage within North Central Kansas, but by 2 a.m. CDT the back edge of lingering stratiform rain also departed the area to the north-northeast, ending this concern as well. Following a lull for a few hours, one last gasp of overnight convection occurred between 4:30-5:30 a.m. CDT as another, weaker storm cluster with perhaps small hail traversed mainly Mitchell County before vacating eastward.","","CSV"

The impetus for convective development was a trailing cold front, extending from a departing system across the Great Lakes. The combination of solar insolation beneath cold temperatures aloft yielded strong instability, and with strong magnitudes of organizing wind shear, fostered development of numerous supercell thunderstorms. While wind shear over deep layers was quite strong, low-level wind shear was rather weak, promoting a favorable environment for large hail production. Numerous large to very large hailstones were noted across the southern county warning area during the afternoon into early evening. The most impactful event was a supercell storm that impacted the community of Ada, producing reports of hail as large as six inches in diameter, and leading to significant property damage.","","CSV"

A few specific reports featured: golf ball size stones in extreme southwestern Rooks County; quarter to ping pong ball size hail in the Zurich/Plainville vicinity and also the Natoma area. Following the departure of the main round of convection, a wake low developed along the backside of the trailing stratiform rain shield, prompting a period of strong to marginally-severe winds that affected primarily Smith, Osborne and Jewell counties between 12-2 a.m. CDT on the 14th. In fact, Smith Center Municipal Airport registered a roughly 90-minute period of sustained winds at least 30-40 MPH and gusts 50-60 MPH, including a peak gust of 62 MPH...prompting some area power outages. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing, and starting with the big picture in the mid-upper levels, strengthening west-southwesterly flow and upper level divergence overspread the Central Plains, downstream from a larger-scale low digging southward through the western United States. At the surface, North Central Kansas resided along (but mainly just north) of a west-southwest to east-northeast oriented warm front, attendant to a roughly 999 millibar low pressure center that tracked from west central to northeast Kansas during the evening. Given that the warm front resided mainly just south of the local area, truly surface-based instability was held in check (as evidenced by surface dewpoints only peaking in the upper 40s-low 50s F). However, slightly elevated, most-unstable CAPE of at least 1000 J/kg nosed into the southern reaches of the area, accompanied by moderately strong deep-layer wind shear of 35-45 knots. As forcing increased along the low-level frontal zone early in the evening, storms first initiated barely south of North Central Kansas over Trego/Ellis counties between 5-6 p.m. CDT. Then, between 6-9 p.m. CDT, the initial storms morphed into a slow-moving, severe storm cluster that trudged across mainly southern Rooks County into southwestern Osborne County, yielding the various hail reports along the way. Over the next few hours this storm cluster picked up eastward momentum, while slowly weakening and becoming a bit more linear in nature, although thunderstorm wind gusts as detected by various mesonets remained slightly sub-severe before the main round of convection departed the local area out of Mitchell County between 11-11:30 p.m. CDT. Shortly thereafter, the aforementioned wake low winds took center stage within North Central Kansas, but by 2 a.m. CDT the back edge of lingering stratiform rain also departed the area to the north-northeast, ending this concern as well. Following a lull for a few hours, one last gasp of overnight convection occurred between 4:30-5:30 a.m. CDT as another, weaker storm cluster with perhaps small hail traversed mainly Mitchell County before vacating eastward.","","CSV"

Along and ahead of this front, scattered showers and thunderstorms developed across eastern Nebraska the afternoon of the 30th. While largely remaining below severe limits, a downburst did result in damage to a warehouse in Lincoln that afternoon. More widespread thunderstorms developed along the stalled frontal boundary the afternoon of the 31st, with numerous reports of funnel clouds across northeast Nebraska. Due to the heavy rain and slow-moving nature of these storms, there were a couple instances of flash flooding as well.

The Sierra Nevada and adjacent foothills generally picked up between an inch and 2 inches of liquid precipitation with several SNOTELS picking up an estimated 12 to 20 inches of new snowfall. Between a quarter and a half of an inch of rain fell across most of the Tehachapi Mountain range while the Kern County Deserts generally had less than a quarter inch of rainfall. Scattered thunderstorm broke out over the San Joaquin Valley  by late morning on January 19 and continued through late afternoon. Several of the  thunderstorms produced heavy rainfall and small hail. There were also several reports of roadway flooding in the Visalia area. The precipitation tapered off by late evening.","California Highway Patrol reported flooding created impassible conditions for small vehicles near the intersection of Oakdale Rd. and SR 59.","CSV"

Wind speeds within the tornado intensified as it approached Spring Grove Road where the first signs of significant structural damage were noted to a home. A couple of homes suffered minor roof damage along Pruetts Chapel Road with further intensification noted on Rockingchair Road and Sandy Lane where significant roof damage occurred to a residence and a couple of outbuildings were completely destroyed.

The front worked with sufficient instability aloft to bring strong wind gusts to the surface, with several in the 45 to 60 MPH range according to various observations.

Extending south and southwest of this surface low into Colorado was a cold front. A secondary low-pressure center was noted in northwestern Kansas where the surface cold front intersected a dry line that extended south into western Texas. |Shortly after midnight, a line of severe thunderstorms along this cold front moved into the OAX CWA.

These storms continued to be severe and tornadic through the morning of the 24th, later being classified as a derecho. |Troughing over the western CONUS continued to bring southwesterly flow aloft the region even behind this first trough. By the evening of the 25th, another shortwave trough had amplified over the Great Basin and had shifted over the Rocky Mountains. Ahead of this disturbance, a low-pressure developed in northwest Kansas, with a warm front extending east-southeast across northern and eastern Kansas. The evening of the 25th, scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developed across this frontal zone in northern Kansas and generally tracked to the east-northeast. As such, scattered thunderstorms moved into southeast Nebraska after 9 PM CDT.

That night, this trough ejected out into the central and northern Great Plains. At the surface, a low-pressure developed in western South Dakota. Extending south and southwest of this surface low into Colorado was a cold front. A secondary low-pressure center was noted in northwestern Kansas where the surface cold front intersected a dry line that extended south into western Texas. |Shortly after midnight, a line of severe thunderstorms along this cold front moved into the OAX CWA. From 05 UTC through 10 UTC, this line of storms brought widespread severe wind gusts up to 110 miles per hour and 17 spin-up tornadoes across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. These storms continued to be severe and tornadic through the morning of the 24th, later being classified as a derecho. |Troughing over the western CONUS continued to bring southwesterly flow aloft the region even behind this first trough. By the evening of the 25th, another shortwave trough had amplified over the Great Basin and had shifted over the Rocky Mountains. Ahead of this disturbance, a low-pressure developed in northwest Kansas, with a warm front extending east-southeast across northern and eastern Kansas. The evening of the 25th, scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developed across this frontal zone in northern Kansas and generally tracked to the east-northeast. As such, scattered thunderstorms moved into southeast Nebraska after 9 PM CDT. While largely remaining below severe limits, severe straight-line winds were observed along the south and east side of the Omaha metro as a thunderstorm tracked from western Otoe into eastern Pottawattamie County.

The impetus for convective development was a trailing cold front, extending from a departing system across the Great Lakes. The combination of solar insolation beneath cold temperatures aloft yielded strong instability, and with strong magnitudes of organizing wind shear, fostered development of numerous supercell thunderstorms. While wind shear over deep layers was quite strong, low-level wind shear was rather weak, promoting a favorable environment for large hail production. Numerous large to very large hailstones were noted across the southern county warning area during the afternoon into early evening. The most impactful event was a supercell storm that impacted the community of Ada, producing reports of hail as large as six inches in diameter, and leading to significant property damage.","","CSV"

The impetus for convective development was a trailing cold front, extending from a departing system across the Great Lakes. The combination of solar insolation beneath cold temperatures aloft yielded strong instability, and with strong magnitudes of organizing wind shear, fostered development of numerous supercell thunderstorms. While wind shear over deep layers was quite strong, low-level wind shear was rather weak, promoting a favorable environment for large hail production. Numerous large to very large hailstones were noted across the southern county warning area during the afternoon into early evening. The most impactful event was a supercell storm that impacted the community of Ada, producing reports of hail as large as six inches in diameter, and leading to significant property damage.","Relayed image.

While largely remaining below severe limits, severe straight-line winds were observed along the south and east side of the Omaha metro as a thunderstorm tracked from western Otoe into eastern Pottawattamie County. It was estimated wind gusts reached as high as 70 miles per hour with this storm, with power outages being reported due to the winds.","This brief spin-up tornado touched down near the intersection of 120th Street and O Avenues where it destroyed an outbuilding. The tornado then traveled northeast where it rolled over a camper and tore the roof off of a garage outbuilding. Peak winds in this tornado were estimated to be at 74 miles per hour. The track width of this tornado was 30 yards.","CSV"

This resulted in isolated instances of flash flooding, especially for rural portions of western Wayne County where several roads were reported under water.||By 4 am, A round of strong to severe thunderstorms entered eastern Nebraska from the west and south. These storms were co-located with a tongue of enhanced instability and low-level shear as the surface low occluded in central Nebraska. Scattered instances of damaging wind and continued isolated flooding were reported through the early morning hours.||While the main round of thunderstorms continued east into Iowa and Missouri by late morning, continued redevelopment of thunderstorms persisted through the afternoon hours across portions of northeast Nebraska. This resulted from forcing for ascent and steep lapse rates associated with the cut-off low lingering in central Nebraska. Just before noon through the early afternoon hours on the 16th, the Omaha-Valley NWS received reports of funnel clouds and brief spin-up tornadoes associated with these storms. NWS damage surveys concluded that there were 4 EF-0 tornadoes, two in Platte County and two in Colfax County. Scattered showers and storms lingered across the area through the evening of the 16th as the low-pressure system weakened and slowly moved northeast into the upper Midwest.","Detailed reports from a combination of emergency management, eyewitnesses, and video evidence from storm spotters indicate this as the path of the tornado.

The impetus for convective development was a trailing cold front, extending from a departing system across the Great Lakes. The combination of solar insolation beneath cold temperatures aloft yielded strong instability, and with strong magnitudes of organizing wind shear, fostered development of numerous supercell thunderstorms. While wind shear over deep layers was quite strong, low-level wind shear was rather weak, promoting a favorable environment for large hail production. Numerous large to very large hailstones were noted across the southern county warning area during the afternoon into early evening. The most impactful event was a supercell storm that impacted the community of Ada, producing reports of hail as large as six inches in diameter, and leading to significant property damage.","MPing report.

This placed New England on the warm side of the storm with strong SE winds and rain instead of snow. This lead to widespread river flooding and coastal flooding on both the south and east coasts of southern New England. The heaviest rain fell over eastern CT, RI, and eastern MA with totals of 1 to 3 inches which added to already saturated ground from previous storms. Along the coast, a storm surge of 2 to 3 feet led to minor to moderate coastal flooding and additional beach erosion in the same areas that were impacted from the previous storm.","Flooding as deep as 2 to 3 feet affected many of the same locations that were flooded during the January 9-10, 2024 storm including Branch Avenue, Valley Street, Charles Street, Hartford Avenue, and Pocasset Avenue in Providence.","CSV"
