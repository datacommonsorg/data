# NOAA Storm Events Import

This directory contains scripts to download, process, and import storm event data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

## Scripts

- `download_script.py`: Downloads the raw storm data from the NOAA website.
- `shard_noaa_data.py`: Processes the raw CSV files and shards them into smaller files based on the `STATE_FIPS` code. This allows for parallel processing in the next step.
- `process_noaa_data.py`: Cleans and processes the sharded data. It resolves geo-locations, formats dates, and generates the final cleaned CSV file for import.

## Data

- `output/storm_noaa.tmcf`: Template MCF file for the storm data.
- `noaa_storm_output/cleaned_storm_data.csv`: The final cleaned and processed data, ready for import. This is generated by `process_noaa_data.py`.

## Manifest

- `manifest.json`: Contains the import specifications for the Data Commons import system.

## Running the import

To run the full import process, execute the scripts in the following order:

1.  `python3 download_script.py`
2.  `python3 shard_noaa_data.py`
3.  `python3 process_noaa_data.py`
