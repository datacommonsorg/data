"NOTE: Title IV institutions are those with a written agreement with the Secretary of Education that allows the institution to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. The rates in this table reflect graduation rates at institutions regardless of the length of programs, unless otherwise indicated. The graduation rate was calculated as required for disclosure and reporting purposes under the Student Right-to-Know Act. This rate was calculated as the total number of completers within specified time to degree divided by the revised cohort minus any allowable exclusions. The revised cohort is the number of students entering the institution as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking undergraduates in the cohort year. Allowable exclusions include those students who died or were totally and permanently disabled; those who left school to serve in the armed forces; those who left to serve with a foreign aid service of the federal government, such as the Peace Corps; and those who left to serve on official church missions. Definitions for terms used in this table may be found in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) online glossary located at http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/glossary. ",,,,,
