"NOTE: Title IV institutions are those with a written agreement with the U.S. Department of Education that allows the institution to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. The four U.S. service academies that are not Title IV eligible are included in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) universe because they are federally funded and open to the public. The rates in this table reflect graduation rates at institutions regardless of the length of programs, unless otherwise indicated. The graduation rate was calculated as required for disclosure and reporting purposes under the Student Right-to-Know Act. This rate was calculated as the total number of completers within 100, 150, or 200 percent of normal time (e.g. “normal” program completion time for a bachelor’s degree would be 4 years) divided by the adjusted cohort (revised cohort minus any allowable exclusions). The revised cohort is the number of students entering the institution as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking undergraduates in the reference year. Allowable exclusions include those students who died or were totally and permanently disabled; students who left school to serve in the armed forces (or have been called up to active duty); those who left to serve with a foreign aid service of the federal government, such as the Peace Corps; and those who left to serve on official church missions. Definitions for terms used in this table may be found in the IPEDS online glossary located at https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/VisGlossaryAll.aspx.",,,,,,
