"NOTE: Title IV institutions are those with a written agreement with the U.S. Department of Education that allows the institution to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. The four U.S. service academies that are not Title IV eligible are included in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) universe because they are federally funded and open to the public. Percentages in the columns of this table use the corresponding dollar amount in the appropriate total row of each section as the denominator. Due to differences between GASB standards and FASB standards, figures from public institutions are not comparable with figures from private institutions, even in categories with identical labels. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Definitions for terms used in this table may be found in the IPEDS online glossary located at https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/VisGlossaryAll.aspx.
