"1 In addition to the public institutions using Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) standards, 17 public institutions (0.9 percent of public institutions) not displayed in this table reported $15.4 billion in revenue and investment return and $15.7 billion in expenses using Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) standards.",,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Title IV institutions are those with a written agreement with the U.S. Department of Education that allows the institution to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. United States includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, and the U.S. Air Force Academy are not Title IV eligible but are included in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) universe because they are federally funded and open to the public; they are included in this table. The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy is Title IV eligible and also included in this table. Percentages in the columns of this table use the corresponding dollar amount in the appropriate total row of each section as the denominator. Due to differences between Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) standards and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) standards, figures from public institutions are not comparable with figures from private institutions, even in categories with identical labels. FDSL is the Federal Direct Student Loan program. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Definitions for terms used in this table may be found in the IPEDS online glossary located at https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/glossary. The glossary is primarily focused on terms used in the current IPEDS collection and may not reflect the definitions in effect when the data in this table were collected.",,,,,,,,,
