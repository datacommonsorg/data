"NOTE: Title IV institutions are those with a written agreement with the U.S. Department of Education that allows the institution to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. United States includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, and the U.S. Air Force Academy are not Title IV eligible but are included in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) universe because they are federally funded and open to the public; they are included in this table. The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy is Title IV eligible and is also included in this table. Percentages in the columns of this table use the corresponding dollar amount in the appropriate total row of each section as the denominator. Due to differences between GASB standards and FASB standards, figures from public institutions are not comparable with figures from private institutions, even in categories with identical labels. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Definitions for terms used in this table may be found in the collection year's archived downloadable glossary located at https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/annual-survey-forms-packages-archived?year=2021.",,,,,,,,,
