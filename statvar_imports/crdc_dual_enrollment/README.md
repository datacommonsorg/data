# Dual Enrollment Data Import

This directory contains scripts and data for importing school-level dual enrollment statistics into Data Commons.

## Data Source

The data is sourced from the U.S. Department of Education's Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC). The raw data files are downloaded from the [CRDC website](https://civilrightsdata.ed.gov/data).

## File Descriptions

-   `download.py`: This script downloads the CRDC data archives for various years, extracts them, and moves the relevant "Dual Enrollment" files into the `source/` directory.
-   `preprocess.py`: This script processes the raw data files from the `source/` directory. It adds a `Year` column to each file based on the filename and saves the processed CSV files to the `preprocessed/` directory.
-   `dual_enrollment_pvmap.csv`: This is the property-value map used to map the columns in the preprocessed data to the corresponding Data Commons properties for generating Statistical Variables.
-   `metadata.csv`: Contains metadata for the import process.
-   `source/`: This directory contains the raw data files downloaded by `download.py`.
-   `preprocessed/`: This directory contains the CSV files after they have been processed by `preprocess.py`.
-   `output/`: This directory contains the final output files (`.mcf`, `.tmcf`, and `.csv`) generated by the import process.

## Instructions

To run the import, follow these steps:

1.  **Download the data:**
    ```bash
    python3 download.py
    ```
    This will populate the `source/` directory with the necessary raw data files.

2.  **Preprocess the data:**
    ```bash
    python3 preprocess.py
    ```
    This will process the files in `source/` and save the results to the `preprocessed/` directory.

3.  **Generate the final output:**
    After preprocessing, the data is ready to be imported into Data Commons using the `datacommons` command-line tool.

## Generated Statistical Variables

The import generates `Count` Statistical Variables for students participating in dual enrollment programs, disaggregated by:

-   Race
-   Ethnicity (for Hispanic or Latino)
-   Gender
-   English Proficiency Status
-   Disability Status
