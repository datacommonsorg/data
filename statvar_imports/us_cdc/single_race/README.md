```
After the files are downloaded, the data is processed using the stat_var_processor.py script. The script uses various command-line arguments to specify the input data, pvmap, configuration file, and  output path.


```bash

	python3 ../../../tools/statvar_importer/stat_var_processor.py --existing_statvar_mcf=gs://unresolved_mcf/scripts/statvar/stat_vars.mcf --input_data=input_files/*.csv --pv_map=single_race_pvmap.csv --config_file=single_race_metadata.csv --output_path=output/underlyingcauseofdeath2018_2023singlerace
