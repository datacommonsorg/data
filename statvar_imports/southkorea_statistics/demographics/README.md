To get the necessary data files, you'll need to manually download source files.
**population**: <https://kosis.kr/statHtml/statHtml.do?sso=ok&returnurl=https%3A%2F%2Fkosis.kr%3A443%2FstatHtml%2FstatHtml.do%3Flist_id%3DA11_2015_1%26obj_var_id%3D%26seqNo%3D%26tblId%3DDT_1IN1502%26vw_cd%3DMT_ETITLE%26language%3Den%26orgId%3D101%26path%3D%252Feng%252FstatisticsList%252FstatisticsListIndex.do%26conn_path%3DMT_ETITLE%26itm_id%3D%26lang_mode%3Den%26scrId%3D%26>

Here are the specific commands for each file:

```bash
python3 ../../../tools/statvar_importer/stat_var_processor.py --input_data=source_files/population_data.csv --pv_map=population_pvmap.csv --config_file=population_metadata.csv --places_resolved_csv=population_places_resolved_csv.csv --existing_statvar_mcf=gs://unresolved_mcf/scripts/statvar/stat_vars.mcf --output_path=output/population",
```
```bash
python3 ../../../tools/statvar_importer/stat_var_processor.py --input_data=source_files/population_density_data.csv --pv_map=population_density_pvmap.csv --config_file=population_density_metadata.csv --places_resolved_csv=population_density_places_resolved_csv.csv --existing_statvar_mcf=gs://unresolved_mcf/scripts/statvar/stat_vars.mcf --output_path=output/population_density"
