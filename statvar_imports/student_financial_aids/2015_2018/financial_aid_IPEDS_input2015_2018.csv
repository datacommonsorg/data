"NOTE: Title IV institutions are those with a written agreement with the U.S. Department of Education that allows the institution to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. United States includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, and the U.S. Air Force Academy are not Title IV eligible but are included in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) universe because they are federally funded and open to the public; they are included in this table. The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy is Title IV eligible and is also included in this table. The graduation rate was calculated as required for disclosure and reporting purposes under the Student Right-to-Know Act. This rate was calculated no later than August 31, 2021 as the total number of completers within 150 percent of normal time (e.g., ""normal"" program completion time for a bachelor's degree would be 4 years) at the same institution where the student started divided by the adjusted cohort (revised cohort minus any allowable exclusions). For institutions following a semester, trimester, 4-1-4, or other academic year calendar system, the revised cohort is the number of students entering the institution as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking undergraduates in the fall of the cohort year. For institutions following calendars that differ by program or allow continuous enrollment, the revised cohort is the number of students entering the institution as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking undergraduates from September 1 of the cohort year through August 31 of the following year. Allowable exclusions include those students who died or were totally and permanently disabled; students who left school to serve in the armed forces (or have been called up to active duty); those who left to serve with a foreign aid service of the federal government, such as the Peace Corps; and those who left to serve on official church missions.
