# US_Urban_Schools_Teachers_And_Staff Import

This import focuses on data about full-time equivalent (FTE) teachers and staff in urban schools across the United States.

-----

## ⚙️ Workflow

The workflow for this data import involves two main steps: downloading the necessary files and then processing them.

### Step 1: Download the Source Data

To acquire the necessary data files, execute the download script `download.py`.

```bash
python3 download.py --data_type=teachers
```

All downloaded files will be stored in the directory `teachers/input_files`.

-----

### Step 2: Process the Files

After successfully downloading the files, run the processing script to generate the final output artifacts. There are two ways to do this:

**Option A: Use the `run.sh` script**

The `run.sh` script automates the processing of all the downloaded files.

**Run the following command:**

```bash
sh run.sh
```

**Option B: Manually Execute the Processing Script**

#### **Execution Commands**

The final output is generated by processing the downloaded data using the stat_var_processor.py script, which is located in the data/tools/statvar_importer/ directory.
