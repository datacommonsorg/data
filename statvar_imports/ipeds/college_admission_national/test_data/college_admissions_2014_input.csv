"NOTE: Title IV institutions are those with a written agreement with the U.S. Department of Education that allows the institution to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. The four U.S. service academies that are not Title IV eligible are included in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) universe because they are federally funded and open to the public. Individuals may apply to, be admitted at, and enroll at more than one institution. The counts presented in this table are aggregated across institutions and are not unduplicated. Definitions for terms used in this table may be found in the IPEDS online glossary located at https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/VisGlossaryAll.aspx.",,,,,,,,,,
