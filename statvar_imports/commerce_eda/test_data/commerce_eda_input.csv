We are using 19.5 because values for percent in poverty are reflected to one decimal point and EDA rounds up to whole integers.  Counties without a numerical percent in poverty are coded as NA.  These included areas that were not in existence, experienced a boundary change or are uninhabited. See Technical Documentation for more details.",,,,,,,,,
