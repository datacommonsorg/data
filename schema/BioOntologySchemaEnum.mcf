In the absence of calmodulin, the mixture of the two fragments does not exhibit detectable activity, suggesting that the two fragments do not associate. When expressed in an adenylate cyclase-deficient E. coli strain (E. coli lacks calmodulin or calmodulin-related proteins), the T25 and T18 fragments fused to putative interacting proteins are brought into close association which result in cAMP synthesis. The level of reconstructed adenylate cyclase can be estimated by monitoring the expression of a cAMP dependent reporter gene. The T25 tagged protein is generally regarded as the bait, the T18 as the prey"

Linearly polarized light can be viewed as a superposition of two components of circularly polarized light of equal amplitude and phase but opposite handness. When this light passes through an optically active sample the two polarized components are absorbed differently. The difference in left and right handed absorbance A(l)- A(r) is the signal registered in CD spectra. This signal displays distinct features corresponding to different secondary structures present in peptides, proteins and nucleic acids. The analysis of CD spectra can therefore yield valuable information about the secondary structure of biological macromolecules and the interactions among molecules that influence their structure"

The interaction of two proteins causes a shift in the fluorescence emission spectrum relative to the sum of the individual fluorescence spectra, resulting in a difference spectrum [F (complex)-2 F (sum)], which is a measurable effect of the interaction.

description: "The classical two-hybrid system is a method that uses transcriptional activity as a measure of protein-protein interaction. It relies on the modular nature of many site-specific transcriptional activators (GAL 4) , which consist of a DNA-binding domain and a transcriptional activation domain. The DNA-binding domain serves to target the activator to the specific genes that will be expressed, and the activation domain contacts other proteins of the transcriptional machinery to enable transcription to occur. The two-hybrid system is based on the observation that the two domains of the activator need to be non-covalently brought together by the interaction of any two proteins. The application of this system requires the expression of two hybrid. Generally this assay is performed in yeast cell, but it can also be carried out in other organism. The bait protein is fused to the DNA binding molecule, the prey to the transcriptional activator"

The magnetic interaction of two paramagnetic centres in a protein can be used to calculate the distance between them; this allows studies of the movements and interactions of protein segments. In proteins without any intrinsic unpaired electrons it is possible to attach a radical probe (spin label).

Cell lysates can also be fractionated before gel electrophoresis to increase the sensitivity of the method for detecting interactions with rare proteins. Denaturants are removed during the blotting procedure, which allows many proteins to recover (or partially recover) activity. However, if biological activity is not recoverable, the proteins can be fractionated by a non denaturing gel system. This variation of the method eliminates the problem of activity regeneration and allows the detection of binding when the presence of a protein complex is required for binding. The protein probe can be prepared by any one of several procedures, while fusion affinity tags greatly facilitate purification. Synthesis in E. coli with a GST fusion, epitope tag, or other affinity tag is most commonly used.

This is accomplished experimentally by excitation with plane-polarized light, followed by measurement of the emission at parallel and perpendicular planes. Since rotational correlation times depend on the size of the molecule, this method can be used to measure the binding of two proteins because the observed polarization increase when a larger complex is formed. A fluorescence anisotropy experiment is normally carried out with a protein bearing a covalently added fluorescent group, which increases both the observed fluorescence lifetime of the excited state and the intensity of the fluorescent signal. Residue modification can be assessed by addition of an antibody which binds to the modified residue and alters the molecular weight of the complex. A variation of this technique has been used to show interaction of a DNA binding protein with another protein. In this case the DNA rather than protein is fluorescently labelled"

description: "Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measures directly the energy associated with a chemical reaction triggered by the mixing of two components. A typical ITC experiment is carried out by the stepwise addition of one of the reactants (~10-6 L per injection) into the reaction cell (~1mL) containing the second reactant. The chemical reaction occurring after each injection either releases or absorbs heat (qi) proportional to the amount of ligand that binds to the protein with a characteristic binding enthalpy (DH). As modern ITC instruments operate on the heat compensation principle, the instrumental response (measured signal) is the amount of power (microcalories per second) necessary to maintain constant the temperature difference between the reaction and the reference cells. Because the amount of uncomplexed protein available progressively decreases after each successive injection, the magnitude of the peaks becomes progressively smaller until complete saturation is achieved. The difference between the concentration of bound ligand in the ith and (i-1)th injections depends on the binding constant Ka and the total ligand injected. The calculations depend on the binding model (number of substrates). Analysis of the data yields DH and DG = -RTlnKa. The entropy change is obtained by using the standard thermodynamic expression DG = DH-TDS"

When the ribosome reaches the RNA-DNA junction the ribosome stalls and the puromycin moiety enters the peptidyltransferase site of the ribosome and forms a covalent linkage to the nascent polypeptide. As a result the protein and the mRNA are covalently joined and can be isolated from the ribosome and purified. In the current protocol, a cDNA strand is then synthesised to form a less sticky RNA-DNA hybrid and these complexes are finally used for affinity selection. As in most display approaches, several selections cycles (3-6) are sufficient to enrich for mRNAs encoding ligand proteins"

description: "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an effect whereby magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field absorb and re-emit electromagnetic (EM) energy. Certain atomic nuclei, and in particular hydrogen, have a magnetic moment or spin; i.e., they have an intrinsic magnetisation, like a bar magnet. The spin aligns along the strong magnetic field, but can be changed to a misaligned excited state in response to applied radio frequency (RF) pulses of electromagnetic radiation. When the excited hydrogen nuclei relax to their aligned state, they emit RF radiation, which can be measured and displayed as a spectrum. The nature of the emitted radiation depends on the environment of each hydrogen nucleus, and if one nucleus is excited, it will influence the absorption and emission of radiation by other nuclei that lie close to it. It is consequently possible, by an ingenious elaboration of the basic NMR technique known as two-dimensional NMR, to distinguish the signals from hydrogen nuclei in different amino acid residues and to identify and measure the small shifts in these signals that occur when these hydrogen nuclei lie close enough to interact: the size of such a shift reveals the distance between the interacting pair of hydrogen atoms. In this way NMR can give information about the distances between the parts of the interacting molecule. NMR provides information about interacting atoms thereby permitting to obtain information about macromolecular structure and molecular interactions"

The bait protein, immobilized on a solid support (plastic, agarose, sepharose, magnetic beads and others) is soaked in the phage mixture and that phage that remains attached to the bait is amplified and carried through a further affinity purification step. Each cycle results in an approximately 1,000-fold enrichment of specific phage and after a few selection rounds (2-4), DNA sequencing of the tight-binding phage reveals only a small number of sequences. Phage display panning experiments can be carried out either on libraries of peptides of random amino acid sequence or on libraries of displaying natural peptides obtained by inserting cDNA fragments into the phage vector (cDNA libraries).

As a consequence when the mRNA is translated in vitro the domain can fold while the tether is still in the ribosomal tunnel. Furthermore this chimeric mRNAs lack a stop codon, thus preventing release of the mRNA and the polypeptide from the ribosome. High concentrations of magnesium and low temperature further stabilise the ternary complex. Similarly to phage display, these complexes can be used directly to select for nucleic acids encoding proteins with desired properties"

Biomolecules that interact with the immobilized ligand are retained on the surface, and alter the resonance angle of impinging light as a result of the change in refractive index brought about by the increased biomolecule mass retained on the surface. Since all the biomolecules belonging to the same class have the same refractive index and since there is a linear correlation between resonance angle shift and biomolecule concentration near the surface, this allows one to measure changes in concentration at the surface as a consequence of interaction.

The position and intensity of each spot in the X-ray diffraction pattern contain information about the position and nature of the atoms in the crystal. The three-dimensional structure of a large molecule can be deduced from the electron-density map of its crystal. In recent years X-ray diffraction analysis has become increasingly automated, and now the slowest step is likely to be the production of suitable macromolecule crystals. This requires high concentration of very pure macromolecule and empirical searching for the proper crystallization conditions"

In parallel a sample of DNA that is not enriched by immunoprecipitation is subjected to LM-PCR in the presence of a different fluorophore (Cy3), and both immunoprecipitation (IP)-enriched and unenriched pools of labeled DNA were hybridized to a single DNA microarray containing a set of intergenic sequences. The ratio of the Cy5 to Cy3 fluorescence intensities measured at each DNA element in the microarray provided a measure of the extent of binding of the transcription factor to the corresponding genomic locus"

RNAi or dsRNA-induced silencing phenomena are present in evolutionarily diverse organisms, e.g., nematodes, plants, fungi, and trypanosomes. The mechanisms by which RNAi works is initiated by a progressive cleavage of dsRNA into 21 to 23 nucleotide (nt) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These native siRNA duplexes are then incorporated into a protein complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). ATP-dependent unwinding of the siRNA duplex generates an active RISC complex. Guided by the antisense strand of siRNA, the active RISC complex recognizes and cleaves the corresponding mRNA"

Following a washing step to remove unbound secondary ligand, the extent to which a chromogenic substrate (e.g. 3,3', 5,5' tetramethyl benzidine chromogen [TMB]) is converted to a soluble coloured product by the conjugated enzyme in a given time is determined by spectrophotometry using a standard microplate absorbance reader. A similar type of approach can be utilized to detect enzymatic activities. The substrate, attached to a solid phase is incubated in the presence of the enzyme and the enzymatic modification is monitored by an antibody that is specific for the modified substrate (for instance a phosphorylated protein)"

DMS induces methylation of guanine residues so DNA interaction with protein binding to AT rich sequences or to the phosphate backbone may be not detected by DMS footprinting. However as DMS diffuses across membrane it can also be used for in vivo footprinting. The experiment involves the treatment with DMS of two DNA samples with identical sequence, one protein bound and the other naked. The two samples are treated with piperidine to induce chemical cleavage of the DMS modified guanine residues followed by digestion with restriction enzymes. Once labelled the samples are run in parallel on a gel to visualize the pattern of nested fragments sharing a common end generated by restriction enzyme(or PCR primer extension) and a variable end guanine dependent. The missing bands of the protein bound sample correspond to the guanine residues protected from modification by an interaction"

The corresponding target (prey) protein is fused to the N-terminal domain of the alfa-subunit of RNA polymerase (248 amino acids). The bait is tethered to the lambda operator sequence upstream of the reporter promoter through the DNA-binding domain of lambdacI. When the bait and prey interact, they recruit and stabilize the binding of RNA polymerase at the promoter and activate the transcription of the HIS3 reporter gene. Due to the tendency of both the lambda repressor protein and the N-terminal domain of the alfa-subunit of RNA polymerase to dimerize, this system might not be optimal for the analysis of proteins that self-associate unless their interaction with other protein partners depends on the oligomerization"

Only the light from the single point illuminated of the specimen passing through the image pinhole is detected by a photodetector. Usually a computer is used to control the sequential scanning of the sample and to assemble the image for display onto a video screen"

description: "AlphaScreen relies on the use of Donor and Acceptor beads that are coated with a layer of hydrogel providing functional groups for bioconjugation. When a biological interaction between molecules brings the beads into proximity, a cascade of chemical reactions is initiated to produce a greatly amplified signal. Upon laser excitation, a photosensitizer in the Donor bead converts ambient oxygen to a more excited singlet state. The singlet state oxygen molecules diffuse across to react with a chemiluminescer in the Acceptor bead that further activates fluorophores contained within the same bead. The fluorophores subsequently emit light at 520-620 nm. In the absence of a specific biological interaction, the singlet state oxygen molecules produced by the Donor bead go undetected without the close proximity of the Acceptor bead. AlphaScreen has successfully been developed for enzyme assays (kinase, helicase, protease, ...), interaction assays (ligand/receptor, protein/protein, protein/DNA), immunoassays, and GPCR functional assays (cAMP, IP3)"

If the contact points are methylated, the protein binding is prevented. After isolating the protein-DNA complex, the methylation sites are cleaved by chemical method. As a result, only those regions out of the binding sites will be cleaved. The protein binding region is not methylated; hence, this region is not cleaved. Although the pattern looks like a footprint, the blank region means \"contact points\""

description: "Chromosome conformation capture,[1] or 3C, is a high-throughput molecular biology technique used to analyze the organization of chromosomes in a cell's natural state. The basic 3C technique consists of cross-linking by addition of formaldehyde followed by addition of a restriction enzyme in excess to the cross-linked DNA, separating the non-cross-linked DNA from the cross-linked chromatin. A intramolecular ligation step using very low concentrations of DNA favors the ligation of relevant DNA fragments with the corresponding junctions instead of the ligation of random fragments. There are two major types of ligation junctions that are over-represented. One is the junction that forms between neighboring DNA fragments due to incomplete digestion, which represents about 20-30% of all junctions. This number is decreased by reducing the cross-linking stringency in the first step. The other type of junctions over-represented in this technique is the junction that forms when one end of the fragment ligates with the other end of the same fragment, and contributes up to 30% of all junctions formed. High temperature then results in the reversal of the previously formed cross-links. The resulting linear DNA fragment has specific restriction ends as well as a central restriction site corresponding to the site of ligation. The pool of these fragments is collectively referred to as the 3C library"

If T nucleotides involved in protein-DNA interactions are replaced by deoxyuracil, protein binding is prevented. After isolating the protein-DNA complex, DNA is cleaved with uracil-N-glycosylase, which specifically targets uracil bases, and the products are electrophoresed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. As a result, DNA in which a thymine involved in binding is replaced by uracil will be depleted. Hence, although the pattern looks like a footprint, the blank region means \"contact points\""

The method relies on the incorporation of photoreactive ribonucleoside analogs, such as 4-thiouridine (4-SU) and 6-thioguanosine (6-SG) into nascent RNA transcripts by living cells. Irradiation of the cells by UV light of 365 nm induces efficient crosslinking of photoreactive nucleoside-labeled cellular RNAs to interacting RBPs. Immunoprecipitation of the RBP of interest is followed by isolation of the crosslinked and coimmunoprecipitated RNA. The isolated RNA is converted into a cDNA library and deep sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAR-CLI"

The bait and prey proteins are presented to each other in a binary fashion to detect direct interactions between them, similar to a conventional ELISA. The pentamerisation of the proteins in the prey is achieved through a peptide sequence from the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and increases the local concentration of the ectodomains thereby providing significant avidity gains to enable even very transient interactions to be detected. By normalising the activities of both the bait and prey to predetermined levels prior to screening, interactions having monomeric half-lives of 0.1 sec can be detected with low false positive rates"

Bait and prey interaction leads to phosphorylation of the gp130 anchor by TYK2, followed by recruitment and activation of STAT3, resulting in transcription of a STAT3-dependent reporter system. This approach enables the identification of interactions between proteins, including transmembrane and cytosolic proteins, and their modulation in response to physiological or pharmacological challenges"
