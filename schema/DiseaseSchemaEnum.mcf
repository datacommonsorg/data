Node: dcid:MeSHDescriptorClassTopical
name: "Topical Descriptor"
typeOf: dcs:MeSHDescriptorClassEnum
description: "These records are topical headings that are used to index citations in NLM's MEDLINE database, for cataloging of publications, and other databases, and are searchable in PubMed as [MH]. Most Descriptors indicate the subject of an indexed item, such as a journal article, that is, what the article is about. Descriptors are generally updated on an annual basis but may, on occasion, be updated more frequently."

Node: dcid:MeSHDescriptorClassPublicationType
name: "Publication Type"
typeOf: dcs:MeSHDescriptorClassEnum
description: "These records indicate what the indexed item is, i.e., its genre, rather than what it is about, for example, Historical Article. They may include Publication Components, such as Charts; Publication Formats, such as Editorial; and Study Characteristics, such as Clinical Trial. They function as metadata, rather than being about the content. These records are searchable in PubMed as Publication Type [PT], and the terms in MEDLINE records are labeled as "PT" or <PublicationType> rather than "MH" or <MeSHHeading>. They are listed in category V of the MeSH Tree Structures (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/intro_trees.html). A list is available of publication types with scope notes (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/pubtypes.html)."
