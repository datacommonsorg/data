## Superfund
Superfund is a clean programme run by the US EPA for monitoring and removing contaminated waste sites. 

There are many public datasets that are released from the superfund programme which can be found in sites like [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=Superfund&sort=score+desc%2C+name+asc), [EPA](https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/main/home.page;jsessionid=4A3DD42EA8321FBC2331B1412A22F104), and many others. In the following table we summarize the datasets processed so-far.

All the datasets in this directory and sub-directories are manually downloaded unless specified in the `README.md` file in the respective sub-directories.
