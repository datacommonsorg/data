# EPA Parent Company Information and Ownership of Facilities.

This directory contains scripts to import the EPA parent company information and
facility ownership data from the following GHG table:
- [`V_PARENT_COMPANY_INFO`](https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/ef_metadata_html.ef_metadata_table?p_table_name=V_PARENT_COMPANY_INFO)

The generated parent companies are of type `EpaParentCompany` and they are
attached to a `CensusZipCodeTabulationArea` and `County` (via
`locatedIn` relation).

## Resolution

We create a Node for each unique Parent Company contained in the table:
V_PARENT_COMPANY_INFO. However, since there is no unique "id" for these
companies, we create one using the name (the ID is set to the dcid). This name
to ID scheme only retains the alphanumeric characters and removes all others. As
as example, names "Abc & Xyz Co. LLC " and "Abc & Xyz Co., LLC" would both get
converted to "dcid:EpaParentCompany/AbcAndXyzCoLLC". Note that the "&" gets
converted to "And". Similarly, "U.S.", "U. S." and "United States" all get
mapped to "US".

We use the existing epaGhgrpFacility Ids which already exist in Data Commons to
create an ownership mapping (EpaOrganizationOwnership) between the facility and
Parent Companies for each year. Note that the ownership is expressed via a
percentage and if no percentage is provided it is assumed to be 100.

## Generating and Validating Artifacts

1. To extract existing facility ids, download the table and regenerate the TMCF/CSV, run:

      ```
      ./generate.sh
      ```

2. To run unit tests:

      ```
      python3 -m unittest discover -v -s ../ -p "*_test.py"
      ```

3. To validate the import, run the [dc-import](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/import#using-import-tool) tool as:

    ```
    dc-import lint output/table/*
    dc-import lint output/ownership/* dc_generated/*.mcf
    ```

    This produced the following warning counters, where
    `Existence_MissingReference_locatedIn` is because there are zip codes that
    are not Census ZCTAs (e.g, https://datacommons.org/browser/zip/16873). The
    warnings for 'Existence_MissingReference_Property' are for the parent
    company names not yet existing in Data Commons.
