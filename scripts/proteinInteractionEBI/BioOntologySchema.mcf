In the absence of calmodulin, the mixture of the two fragments does not exhibit detectable activity, suggesting that the two fragments do not associate.

When this light passes through an optically active sample the two polarized components are absorbed differently. The difference in left and right handed absorbance A(l)- A(r) is the signal registered in CD spectra. This signal displays distinct features corresponding to different secondary structures present in peptides, proteins and nucleic acids.

It relies on the modular nature of many site-specific transcriptional activators (GAL 4) , which consist of a DNA-binding domain and a transcriptional activation domain. The DNA-binding domain serves to target the activator to the specific genes that will be expressed, and the activation domain contacts other proteins of the transcriptional machinery to enable transcription to occur. The two-hybrid system is based on the observation that the two domains of the activator need to be non-covalently brought together by the interaction of any two proteins. The application of this system requires the expression of two hybrid. Generally this assay is performed in yeast cell, but it can also be carried out in other organism. The bait protein is fused to the DNA binding molecule, the prey to the transcriptional activator."

description: "Electron paramagnetic resonance: EPR (also called ESR, Electron Spin Resonance) spectroscopy is analogous to NMR, but is based on the excitation of unpaired electrons instead of nuclei. Unpaired (single) electrons are only found in radicals and some metal ions (paramagnetic species); the EPR spectrum provides information about the environment and mobility of the paramagnetic species. The magnetic interaction of two paramagnetic centres in a protein can be used to calculate the distance between them; this allows studies of the movements and interactions of protein segments. In proteins without any intrinsic unpaired electrons it is possible to attach a radical probe (spin label). Stable nitroxide radicals can be bound to amino acid residues, in analogy with fluorescent probes. In combination with site directed mutagenesis this method is used in particular to study structure and assembly of membrane proteins, by measuring with EPR whether an amino acid is in a polar or non polar environment."

Cell lysates can also be fractionated before gel electrophoresis to increase the sensitivity of the method for detecting interactions with rare proteins. Denaturants are removed during the blotting procedure, which allows many proteins to recover (or partially recover) activity. However, if biological activity is not recoverable, the proteins can be fractionated by a non denaturing gel system. This variation of the method eliminates the problem of activity regeneration and allows the detection of binding when the presence of a protein complex is required for binding. The protein probe can be prepared by any one of several procedures, while fusion affinity tags greatly facilitate purification. Synthesis in E. coli with a GST fusion, epitope tag, or other affinity tag is most commonly used. The protein of interest can then be radioactively labelled, biotinylated, or used in the blotting procedure as an unlabeled probe that is detected by a specific antibody."

This is accomplished experimentally by excitation with plane-polarized light, followed by measurement of the emission at parallel and perpendicular planes. Since rotational correlation times depend on the size of the molecule, this method can be used to measure the binding of two proteins because the observed polarization increase when a larger complex is formed. A fluorescence anisotropy experiment is normally carried out with a protein bearing a covalently added fluorescent group, which increases both the observed fluorescence lifetime of the excited state and the intensity of the fluorescent signal. Residue modification can be assessed by addition of an antibody which binds to the modified residue and alters the molecular weight of the complex. A variation of this technique has been used to show interaction of a DNA binding protein with another protein. In this case the DNA rather than protein is fluorescently labelled."

description: "Isothermal titration calorimetry: Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measures directly the energy associated with a chemical reaction triggered by the mixing of two components. A typical ITC experiment is carried out by the stepwise addition of one of the reactants (~10-6 L per injection) into the reaction cell (~1mL) containing the second reactant. The chemical reaction occurring after each injection either releases or absorbs heat (qi) proportional to the amount of ligand that binds to the protein with a characteristic binding enthalpy (DH). As modern ITC instruments operate on the heat compensation principle, the instrumental response (measured signal) is the amount of power (microcalories per second) necessary to maintain constant the temperature difference between the reaction and the reference cells. Because the amount of uncomplexed protein available progressively decreases after each successive injection, the magnitude of the peaks becomes progressively smaller until complete saturation is achieved. The difference between the concentration of bound ligand in the ith and (i-1)th injections depends on the binding constant Ka and the total ligand injected. The calculations depend on the binding model (number of substrates). Analysis of the data yields DH and DG = -RTlnKa. The entropy change is obtained by using the standard thermodynamic expression DG = DH-TDS."

description: "Nuclear magnetic resonance: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an effect whereby magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field absorb and re-emit electromagnetic (EM) energy. Certain atomic nuclei, and in particular hydrogen, have a magnetic moment or spin; i.e., they have an intrinsic magnetisation, like a bar magnet. The spin aligns along the strong magnetic field, but can be changed to a misaligned excited state in response to applied radio frequency (RF) pulses of electromagnetic radiation. When the excited hydrogen nuclei relax to their aligned state, they emit RF radiation, which can be measured and displayed as a spectrum. The nature of the emitted radiation depends on the environment of each hydrogen nucleus, and if one nucleus is excited, it will influence the absorption and emission of radiation by other nuclei that lie close to it. It is consequently possible, by an ingenious elaboration of the basic NMR technique known as two-dimensional NMR, to distinguish the signals from hydrogen nuclei in different amino acid residues and to identify and measure the small shifts in these signals that occur when these hydrogen nuclei lie close enough to interact: the size of such a shift reveals the distance between the interacting pair of hydrogen atoms. In this way NMR can give information about the distances between the parts of the interacting molecule. NMR provides information about interacting atoms thereby permitting to obtain information about macromolecular structure and molecular interactions."

description: "Peptide massfingerprinting: This approach leads to protein identification by matching peptide masses, as measured by mass spectrometry, to the ones calculated from in silico fragmentation of a protein sequence database. A peptide mixture from a tryptic digest is analysed by MALDI-MS (Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry). The list of peptide masses obtained by MALDI MS is automatically compared to the calculated masses of the predicted peptide fragments for each entry in the database. High mass accuracy is very important in order to obtain a statistically significant and unambiguous match This method is best applied to completely sequenced genomes and well characterised proteomes. However, depending on the data quality, proteins that are highly homologous to already characterised proteins (greater than 80 to 90% sequence identity) can also be identified. The retrieved sequence are evaluated by mass accuracy of the peptides, matching of additional peptide masses in the MALDI spectrum after accounting for common modifications such as oxidation, acrylamidation of cysteine and missed cleavages and the use of secondary information (apparent isoelectric point and molecular weight). If any ambiguity about the identification by MALDI-MS still exists, the results must verified by an other identification method. Peptide mass fingerprint is generally carried out with a MALDI-TOF (Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight ) instrument but can also be achieved ESI-TOF (Electrospray Ionisation time-of-flight) or LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) mass spectrometer."

description: "Peptide synthesis: When one of the partners participates in the interaction with a relatively short peptide fragment, it is often convenient to precisely identify the minimal region that supports the interaction by synthesising a series of overlapping peptides and by testing them in the binding assay. Synthetic peptides that are identical with peptides synthesised in vivo are useful experimental tools for such studies. Peptides are routinely synthesised in a test tube from monomeric amino acids by condensation reactions that form peptide bonds. Peptides are constructed sequentially by coupling the C-terminus of a monomeric amino acid to the N-terminus of the growing peptide. To prevent unwanted reactions involving the amino groups and carboxyl groups of the side chains during the coupling steps, a protecting (blocking) group is attached to the side chains. Without these protecting groups, branched peptides would be generated. In the last steps of synthesis, the side chain-protecting groups are removed and the peptide is cleaved from the resin on which synthesis occurs."

Such a library can then be exploited to identify specific phages that display peptides that bind to any given bait molecule for instance an antibody. The selection is performed by a series of cycles of affinity purification known as panning. The bait protein, immobilized on a solid support (plastic, agarose, sepharose, magnetic beads and others) is soaked in the phage mixture and that phage that remains attached to the bait is amplified and carried through a further affinity purification step. Each cycle results in an approximately 1,000-fold enrichment of specific phage and after a few selection rounds (2-4), DNA sequencing of the tight-binding phage reveals only a small number of sequences. Phage display panning experiments can be carried out either on libraries of peptides of random amino acid sequence or on libraries of displaying natural peptides obtained by inserting cDNA fragments into the phage vector (cDNA libraries). Libraries have been assembled on several different phages (Fd, Lambda or T7)."

description: "Sequence tag identification: This approach leads to protein identification by combining mass measurement and short amino acid sequence information obtained by tandem mass spectrometry. This information is then used to automatically find the best match in a sequence database. A mixture of peptides derived from a protease digestion is analysed by nanoelectrospray LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometer or nanoESI MS/MS) mass spectrometry. Electrospray mass spectrometry cannot be applied to dilute samples and is affected by high salt. As a consequence peptides, normally extracted from acrylamide gels by in situ proteolysis, are desalted and concentrated on a microcolumn followed by elution into a capillary used for nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. A first mass spectrum (Normal mass spectrum or Q1 mass spectrum) gives information about the masses of all the peptides. Peptides observed in the normal mass spectrum are isolated in turn and dissociated into fragments by collision with gas molecules within the mass spectrometer. Some of the fragments obtained from a peptide constitute a nested set, differing by one amino acid, and the mass difference between them allows assignment of a partial sequence. The masses of the fragments define the position of the partial sequence in the peptide. Together with the cleavage specificity of the protease used to cleave the protein, and mass information such sequence tag provides much higher search specificity to match the a database entry. The procedure is repeated with several peptides from the digest, resulting in multiple identifications of the same protein or identification of several proteins from the peptide mixture. Unknown proteins can easily be identified by using the high specificity of the peptide sequence tag for searches in most sequence databases including EST or genome databases."

description: "Western blot: Western blot is a procedure to identify and quantify proteins. A mixture of protein is first submitted to an electrophoresis in denaturing condition and then electro-transferred from the gel to a membrane. The membrane is then incubated with a primary antibody specific for a given protein or a specific residue modification in the sample under analysis. A secondary antibody, radiolabelled or fused to fluorophore or to a chromogenic enzyme, targets the first antibody and allows the visualisation of the protein band on the membrane."

description: "X-ray crystallography: Analysis of a diffraction pattern generated by a single crystal. X-rays have a wavelength, typically around 1 Angstrom (the diameter of a hydrogen atom). If a narrow parallel beam of X-rays is directed at a sample of a pure protein, most of the X-rays will pass straight through it. A small fraction, however, will be scattered by the atoms in the sample. If the sample is a well-ordered crystal, the scattered waves will reinforce one another at certain points and will appear as diffraction spots when the X-rays are recorded by a suitable detector. The position and intensity of each spot in the X-ray diffraction pattern contain information about the position and nature of the atoms in the crystal. The three-dimensional structure of a large molecule can be deduced from the electron-density map of its crystal. In recent years X-ray diffraction analysis has become increasingly automated, and now the slowest step is likely to be the production of suitable macromolecule crystals. This requires high concentration of very pure macromolecule and empirical searching for the proper crystallization conditions."

After reversal of the cross-links, the enriched DNA is amplified and labeled with a fluorescent dye (Cy5) by using a ligation-mediatedpolymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR). In parallel a sample of DNA that is not enriched by immunoprecipitation is subjected to LM-PCR in the presence of a different fluorophore (Cy3), and both immunoprecipitation (IP)-enriched and unenriched pools of labeled DNA were hybridized to a single DNA microarray containing a set of intergenic sequences. The ratio of the Cy5 to Cy3 fluorescence intensities measured at each DNA element in the microarray provided a measure of the extent of binding of the transcription factor to the corresponding genomic locus."

description: "Rna interference: RNA interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional gene silencing method reproducing a naturally occurring phenomena. RNAi is the process whereby double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces the sequence-specific degradation of homologous mRNA. RNAi or dsRNA-induced silencing phenomena are present in evolutionarily diverse organisms, e.g., nematodes, plants, fungi, and trypanosomes. The mechanisms by which RNAi works is initiated by a progressive cleavage of dsRNA into 21 to 23 nucleotide (nt) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These native siRNA duplexes are then incorporated into a protein complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). ATP-dependent unwinding of the siRNA duplex generates an active RISC complex. Guided by the antisense strand of siRNA, the active RISC complex recognizes and cleaves the corresponding mRNA."

Association of the two TM results in the ToxR-mediated activation of a reporter gene such as CAT (chloroamphenicol acetyltransferase activity).

Because the particular protein pair expressed in each colony is defined by its position in the array, positive signals identify interacting proteins without further characterization, thus obviating the need for DNA purification and sequencing.

DMS induces methylation of guanine residues so DNA interaction with protein binding to AT rich sequences or to the phosphate backbone may be not detected by DMS footprinting. However as DMS diffuses across membrane it can also be used for in vivo footprinting. The experiment involves the treatment with DMS of two DNA samples with identical sequence, one protein bound and the other naked. The two samples are treated with piperidine to induce chemical cleavage of the DMS modified guanine residues followed by digestion with restriction enzymes. Once labelled the samples are run in parallel on a gel to visualize the pattern of nested fragments sharing a common end generated by restriction enzyme(or PCR primer extension) and a variable end guanine dependent. The missing bands of the protein bound sample correspond to the guanine residues protected from modification by an interaction."

description: "Lambda repressor two hybrid: A protein of interest (the bait) is fused to the full-length bacteriophage lambda repressor protein (lambdacI, 237 amino acids), containing the amino terminal DNA-binding domain and the carboxylterminal dimerization domain. The corresponding target (prey) protein is fused to the N-terminal domain of the alfa-subunit of RNA polymerase (248 amino acids). The bait is tethered to the lambda operator sequence upstream of the reporter promoter through the DNA-binding domain of lambdacI. When the bait and prey interact, they recruit and stabilize the binding of RNA polymerase at the promoter and activate the transcription of the HIS3 reporter gene. Due to the tendency of both the lambda repressor protein and the N-terminal domain of the alfa-subunit of RNA polymerase to dimerize, this system might not be optimal for the analysis of proteins that self-associate unless their interaction with other protein partners depends on the oligomerization."

The chromatography step consists of strong cation exchange material back-to-back with reversed phase material inside fused silica capillaries. The peptides bound to the cation-exchange resin are freed by the gradually increasing salt concentration of the buffer and are subsequently retained by the reversed phase resin. Increasing buffers hydrophobicity progressively elute peptides from the reversed phase packing directly into the mass spectrometer. Typically this mass spectrometer will be a tandem electrospray, so peptides undergo ionization in the liquid phase, are separated in a primary mass spectrometer, analysed in the second mass spectrometer and identified."

Confocal imaging system achieves this by two strategies: a) by illuminating a single point of the specimen at any one time with a focused beam, so that illumination intensity drops off rapidly and b) by the use of blocking a pinhole aperture in a conjugate focal plane to the specimen so that light emitted away from the point in the specimen being illuminated is blocked from reaching the detector. Only the light from the single point illuminated of the specimen passing through the image pinhole is detected by a photodetector. Usually a computer is used to control the sequential scanning of the sample and to assemble the image for display onto a video screen."

description: "P8 filamentous phage display: pVIII is the major coat protein of filamentous phage. Its amino-terminus is exposed to solvent and tolerates the insertion of relatively large peptide fragments. By inserting the peptide coding sequence into the phage copy of the pVIII gene up to 3000 copies of the hybrid proteins can be displayed along the phage capsid. Alternatively the hybrid protein can be encoded on a phagemid that is incorporated in a virus like particle by infection with a helper phage. In this latter case one obtains a chimeric capsid where hybrid proteins are interspersed at different density in an otherwise wild type coat. Because of the high copy number pVIII display is also referred to as high valency display."

description: "Amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay: AlphaScreen relies on the use of Donor and Acceptor beads that are coated with a layer of hydrogel providing functional groups for bioconjugation. When a biological interaction between molecules brings the beads into proximity, a cascade of chemical reactions is initiated to produce a greatly amplified signal. Upon laser excitation, a photosensitizer in the Donor bead converts ambient oxygen to a more excited singlet state. The singlet state oxygen molecules diffuse across to react with a chemiluminescer in the Acceptor bead that further activates fluorophores contained within the same bead. The fluorophores subsequently emit light at 520-620 nm. In the absence of a specific biological interaction, the singlet state oxygen molecules produced by the Donor bead go undetected without the close proximity of the Acceptor bead. AlphaScreen has successfully been developed for enzyme assays (kinase, helicase, protease, ...), interaction assays (ligand/receptor, protein/protein, protein/DNA), immunoassays, and GPCR functional assays (cAMP, IP3)."

Then, a sample containing an unknown quantity of that same antigen is added. This causes the unlabeled (or \"cold\") antigen from the serum to compete with the radiolabeled antigen (\"hot\") for antibody binding sites. As the concentration of \"cold\" antigen is increased, more of it binds to the antibody, displacing the radiolabeled variant, and reducing the ratio of antibody-bound radiolabeled antigen to free radiolabeled antigen.

description: "Chromosome conformation capture assay: Chromosome conformation capture,[1] or 3C, is a high-throughput molecular biology technique used to analyze the organization of chromosomes in a cell's natural state. The basic 3C technique consists of cross-linking by addition of formaldehyde followed by addition of a restriction enzyme in excess to the cross-linked DNA, separating the non-cross-linked DNA from the cross-linked chromatin. A intramolecular ligation step using very low concentrations of DNA favors the ligation of relevant DNA fragments with the corresponding junctions instead of the ligation of random fragments. There are two major types of ligation junctions that are over-represented. One is the junction that forms between neighboring DNA fragments due to incomplete digestion, which represents about 20-30% of all junctions. This number is decreased by reducing the cross-linking stringency in the first step. The other type of junctions over-represented in this technique is the junction that forms when one end of the fragment ligates with the other end of the same fragment, and contributes up to 30% of all junctions formed. High temperature then results in the reversal of the previously formed cross-links. The resulting linear DNA fragment has specific restriction ends as well as a central restriction site corresponding to the site of ligation. The pool of these fragments is collectively referred to as the 3C library."

After isolating the protein-DNA complex, DNA is cleaved with uracil-N-glycosylase, which specifically targets uracil bases, and the products are electrophoresed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. As a result, DNA in which a thymine involved in binding is replaced by uracil will be depleted. Hence, although the pattern looks like a footprint, the blank region means \"contact points\"."

description: "Dissolution profile: The rate of dissolution is a key target for controlling the duration of a drug's effect, and as such, several dosage forms that contain the same active ingredient may be available, differing only in the rate of dissolution. If a drug is supplied in a form that is not readily dissolved, the drug may be released more gradually over time with a longer duration of action. Having a longer duration of action may improve compliance since the medication will not have to be taken as often. Additionally, slow-release dosage forms may maintain concentrations within an acceptable therapeutic range over a long period of time, as opposed to quick-release dosage forms which may result in sharper peaks and troughs in serum concentrations."

The method relies on the incorporation of photoreactive ribonucleoside analogs, such as 4-thiouridine (4-SU) and 6-thioguanosine (6-SG) into nascent RNA transcripts by living cells. Irradiation of the cells by UV light of 365 nm induces efficient crosslinking of photoreactive nucleoside-labeled cellular RNAs to interacting RBPs. Immunoprecipitation of the RBP of interest is followed by isolation of the crosslinked and coimmunoprecipitated RNA. The isolated RNA is converted into a cDNA library and deep sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAR-CLIP"

Recombinant soluble fragments of these proteins are produced in a (generally) mammalian expression cell line and secreted into the medium and produced in two forms: a biotinylated bait which can be captured on a streptavidin-coated solid phase suitable for screening, and a pentamerised enzyme-tagged (beta-lactamase) prey. The bait and prey proteins are presented to each other in a binary fashion to detect direct interactions between them, similar to a conventional ELISA. The pentamerisation of the proteins in the prey is achieved through a peptide sequence from the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and increases the local concentration of the ectodomains thereby providing significant avidity gains to enable even very transient interactions to be detected. By normalising the activities of both the bait and prey to predetermined levels prior to screening, interactions having monomeric half-lives of 0.1 sec can be detected with low false positive rates."

description: "Kiss: KISS (KInase Substrate Sensor) is a protein complementation technology that allows in situ analysis of protein-protein interactions in intact mammalian cells. In this method, which is derived from MAPPIT (mammalian protein-protein interaction trap), the bait protein is coupled to the kinase domain of TYK2, while the prey protein is fused to a fragment of the gp130 cytokine receptor chain. Bait and prey interaction leads to phosphorylation of the gp130 anchor by TYK2, followed by recruitment and activation of STAT3, resulting in transcription of a STAT3-dependent reporter system. This approach enables the identification of interactions between proteins, including transmembrane and cytosolic proteins, and their modulation in response to physiological or pharmacological challenges."
