The DNA-binding domain serves to target the activator to the specific genes that will be expressed, and the activation domain contacts other proteins of the transcriptional machinery to enable transcription to occur. The two-hybrid system is based on the observation that the two domains of the activator need to be non-covalently brought together by the interaction of any two proteins. The application of this system requires the expression of two hybrid. Generally this assay is performed in yeast cell, but it can also be carried out in other organism. The bait protein is fused to the DNA binding molecule, the prey to the transcriptional activator"

Denaturants are removed during the blotting procedure, which allows many proteins to recover (or partially recover) activity. However, if biological activity is not recoverable, the proteins can be fractionated by a non denaturing gel system. This variation of the method eliminates the problem of activity regeneration and allows the detection of binding when the presence of a protein complex is required for binding. The protein probe can be prepared by any one of several procedures, while fusion affinity tags greatly facilitate purification. Synthesis in E. coli with a GST fusion, epitope tag, or other affinity tag is most commonly used.

Since rotational correlation times depend on the size of the molecule, this method can be used to measure the binding of two proteins because the observed polarization increase when a larger complex is formed. A fluorescence anisotropy experiment is normally carried out with a protein bearing a covalently added fluorescent group, which increases both the observed fluorescence lifetime of the excited state and the intensity of the fluorescent signal. Residue modification can be assessed by addition of an antibody which binds to the modified residue and alters the molecular weight of the complex.

A typical ITC experiment is carried out by the stepwise addition of one of the reactants (~10-6 L per injection) into the reaction cell (~1mL) containing the second reactant. The chemical reaction occurring after each injection either releases or absorbs heat (qi) proportional to the amount of ligand that binds to the protein with a characteristic binding enthalpy (DH). As modern ITC instruments operate on the heat compensation principle, the instrumental response (measured signal) is the amount of power (microcalories per second) necessary to maintain constant the temperature difference between the reaction and the reference cells. Because the amount of uncomplexed protein available progressively decreases after each successive injection, the magnitude of the peaks becomes progressively smaller until complete saturation is achieved. The difference between the concentration of bound ligand in the ith and (i-1)th injections depends on the binding constant Ka and the total ligand injected. The calculations depend on the binding model (number of substrates). Analysis of the data yields DH and DG = -RTlnKa. The entropy change is obtained by using the standard thermodynamic expression DG = DH-TDS"

Molecules with a radius that is smaller than the bead size are retained and retarded by the interaction with the matrix. The observation that two proteins, loaded on a sieving column, elute in a fraction(s) corresponding to a MW that is larger than the MW of either protein may be taken as an indication that the two proteins interact. Furthermore this technique provides a conceptually simple method for evaluating the affinity of the interaction"

description: "This method relies on the covalent coupling of mRNA to the nascent polypeptide. The mRNA (natural or artificial) is first covalently linked to a short DNA linker carrying a puromycin moiety. The mRNA mixture is then translated in vitro. When the ribosome reaches the RNA-DNA junction the ribosome stalls and the puromycin moiety enters the peptidyltransferase site of the ribosome and forms a covalent linkage to the nascent polypeptide. As a result the protein and the mRNA are covalently joined and can be isolated from the ribosome and purified. In the current protocol, a cDNA strand is then synthesised to form a less sticky RNA-DNA hybrid and these complexes are finally used for affinity selection. As in most display approaches, several selections cycles (3-6) are sufficient to enrich for mRNAs encoding ligand proteins"

description: "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an effect whereby magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field absorb and re-emit electromagnetic (EM) energy. Certain atomic nuclei, and in particular hydrogen, have a magnetic moment or spin; i.e., they have an intrinsic magnetisation, like a bar magnet. The spin aligns along the strong magnetic field, but can be changed to a misaligned excited state in response to applied radio frequency (RF) pulses of electromagnetic radiation. When the excited hydrogen nuclei relax to their aligned state, they emit RF radiation, which can be measured and displayed as a spectrum. The nature of the emitted radiation depends on the environment of each hydrogen nucleus, and if one nucleus is excited, it will influence the absorption and emission of radiation by other nuclei that lie close to it. It is consequently possible, by an ingenious elaboration of the basic NMR technique known as two-dimensional NMR, to distinguish the signals from hydrogen nuclei in different amino acid residues and to identify and measure the small shifts in these signals that occur when these hydrogen nuclei lie close enough to interact: the size of such a shift reveals the distance between the interacting pair of hydrogen atoms. In this way NMR can give information about the distances between the parts of the interacting molecule. NMR provides information about interacting atoms thereby permitting to obtain information about macromolecular structure and molecular interactions"

The selection is performed by a series of cycles of affinity purification known as panning. The bait protein, immobilized on a solid support (plastic, agarose, sepharose, magnetic beads and others) is soaked in the phage mixture and that phage that remains attached to the bait is amplified and carried through a further affinity purification step. Each cycle results in an approximately 1,000-fold enrichment of specific phage and after a few selection rounds (2-4), DNA sequencing of the tight-binding phage reveals only a small number of sequences. Phage display panning experiments can be carried out either on libraries of peptides of random amino acid sequence or on libraries of displaying natural peptides obtained by inserting cDNA fragments into the phage vector (cDNA libraries).

As a consequence when the mRNA is translated in vitro the domain can fold while the tether is still in the ribosomal tunnel. Furthermore this chimeric mRNAs lack a stop codon, thus preventing release of the mRNA and the polypeptide from the ribosome. High concentrations of magnesium and low temperature further stabilise the ternary complex. Similarly to phage display, these complexes can be used directly to select for nucleic acids encoding proteins with desired properties"

A ligand of interest (small molecule, peptide, protein, sugar, lipid, nucleic acid) is immobilized on a gold surface, and the interacting partner is injected in buffer flow over it. Biomolecules that interact with the immobilized ligand are retained on the surface, and alter the resonance angle of impinging light as a result of the change in refractive index brought about by the increased biomolecule mass retained on the surface. Since all the biomolecules belonging to the same class have the same refractive index and since there is a linear correlation between resonance angle shift and biomolecule concentration near the surface, this allows one to measure changes in concentration at the surface as a consequence of interaction. Furthermore, this is done in real time, allowing direct measurement of both the on-rate and the off-rate and of the affinity constant of complex formation"

A fluorescence assay can also be carried out taking advantage of fMTX binding to reconstituted DHFR. The basis of this assay is that complementary fragments of DHFR, when expressed and reassembled in cells, will bind with high affinity (Kd 5 540 pM) to fMTX in a 1:1 complex. fMTX is retained in cells by this complex, whereas the unbound fMTX is actively and rapidly transported out of the cells.

A small fraction, however, will be scattered by the atoms in the sample. If the sample is a well-ordered crystal, the scattered waves will reinforce one another at certain points and will appear as diffraction spots when the X-rays are recorded by a suitable detector. The position and intensity of each spot in the X-ray diffraction pattern contain information about the position and nature of the atoms in the crystal. The three-dimensional structure of a large molecule can be deduced from the electron-density map of its crystal. In recent years X-ray diffraction analysis has become increasingly automated, and now the slowest step is likely to be the production of suitable macromolecule crystals.

RNAi is the process whereby double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces the sequence-specific degradation of homologous mRNA. RNAi or dsRNA-induced silencing phenomena are present in evolutionarily diverse organisms, e.g., nematodes, plants, fungi, and trypanosomes. The mechanisms by which RNAi works is initiated by a progressive cleavage of dsRNA into 21 to 23 nucleotide (nt) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These native siRNA duplexes are then incorporated into a protein complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). ATP-dependent unwinding of the siRNA duplex generates an active RISC complex. Guided by the antisense strand of siRNA, the active RISC complex recognizes and cleaves the corresponding mRNA"

The second hybrid protein contains the activation domain of GAL4 fused to protein Y tested for its ability to bind the target RNA X. If this interaction occurs the three hybrid reconstructs GAL4 and the transcription of a reporter gene is activated"

A diploid heterozygous organism harbouring mutations in two (or more) genes is induced to sporulate. Resulting spores are meiotic segregants that are haploid and are either wild type or mutant at each locus. Spores are scored for a phenotype, such as loss of viability"

DMS induces methylation of guanine residues so DNA interaction with protein binding to AT rich sequences or to the phosphate backbone may be not detected by DMS footprinting. However as DMS diffuses across membrane it can also be used for in vivo footprinting. The experiment involves the treatment with DMS of two DNA samples with identical sequence, one protein bound and the other naked. The two samples are treated with piperidine to induce chemical cleavage of the DMS modified guanine residues followed by digestion with restriction enzymes. Once labelled the samples are run in parallel on a gel to visualize the pattern of nested fragments sharing a common end generated by restriction enzyme(or PCR primer extension) and a variable end guanine dependent. The missing bands of the protein bound sample correspond to the guanine residues protected from modification by an interaction"

The corresponding target (prey) protein is fused to the N-terminal domain of the alfa-subunit of RNA polymerase (248 amino acids). The bait is tethered to the lambda operator sequence upstream of the reporter promoter through the DNA-binding domain of lambdacI. When the bait and prey interact, they recruit and stabilize the binding of RNA polymerase at the promoter and activate the transcription of the HIS3 reporter gene. Due to the tendency of both the lambda repressor protein and the N-terminal domain of the alfa-subunit of RNA polymerase to dimerize, this system might not be optimal for the analysis of proteins that self-associate unless their interaction with other protein partners depends on the oligomerization"

Only the light from the single point illuminated of the specimen passing through the image pinhole is detected by a photodetector.

description: "AlphaScreen relies on the use of Donor and Acceptor beads that are coated with a layer of hydrogel providing functional groups for bioconjugation. When a biological interaction between molecules brings the beads into proximity, a cascade of chemical reactions is initiated to produce a greatly amplified signal. Upon laser excitation, a photosensitizer in the Donor bead converts ambient oxygen to a more excited singlet state. The singlet state oxygen molecules diffuse across to react with a chemiluminescer in the Acceptor bead that further activates fluorophores contained within the same bead. The fluorophores subsequently emit light at 520-620 nm. In the absence of a specific biological interaction, the singlet state oxygen molecules produced by the Donor bead go undetected without the close proximity of the Acceptor bead. AlphaScreen has successfully been developed for enzyme assays (kinase, helicase, protease, ...), interaction assays (ligand/receptor, protein/protein, protein/DNA), immunoassays, and GPCR functional assays (cAMP, IP3)"

The basic 3C technique consists of cross-linking by addition of formaldehyde followed by addition of a restriction enzyme in excess to the cross-linked DNA, separating the non-cross-linked DNA from the cross-linked chromatin. A intramolecular ligation step using very low concentrations of DNA favors the ligation of relevant DNA fragments with the corresponding junctions instead of the ligation of random fragments. There are two major types of ligation junctions that are over-represented. One is the junction that forms between neighboring DNA fragments due to incomplete digestion, which represents about 20-30% of all junctions. This number is decreased by reducing the cross-linking stringency in the first step. The other type of junctions over-represented in this technique is the junction that forms when one end of the fragment ligates with the other end of the same fragment, and contributes up to 30% of all junctions formed. High temperature then results in the reversal of the previously formed cross-links. The resulting linear DNA fragment has specific restriction ends as well as a central restriction site corresponding to the site of ligation. The pool of these fragments is collectively referred to as the 3C library"

If T nucleotides involved in protein-DNA interactions are replaced by deoxyuracil, protein binding is prevented. After isolating the protein-DNA complex, DNA is cleaved with uracil-N-glycosylase, which specifically targets uracil bases, and the products are electrophoresed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. As a result, DNA in which a thymine involved in binding is replaced by uracil will be depleted. Hence, although the pattern looks like a footprint, the blank region means \"contact points\""

The method relies on the incorporation of photoreactive ribonucleoside analogs, such as 4-thiouridine (4-SU) and 6-thioguanosine (6-SG) into nascent RNA transcripts by living cells. Irradiation of the cells by UV light of 365 nm induces efficient crosslinking of photoreactive nucleoside-labeled cellular RNAs to interacting RBPs. Immunoprecipitation of the RBP of interest is followed by isolation of the crosslinked and coimmunoprecipitated RNA. The isolated RNA is converted into a cDNA library and deep sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAR-CLI"

The bait and prey proteins are presented to each other in a binary fashion to detect direct interactions between them, similar to a conventional ELISA. The pentamerisation of the proteins in the prey is achieved through a peptide sequence from the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and increases the local concentration of the ectodomains thereby providing significant avidity gains to enable even very transient interactions to be detected. By normalising the activities of both the bait and prey to predetermined levels prior to screening, interactions having monomeric half-lives of 0.1 sec can be detected with low false positive rates"

description: "The PIR-International Protein Sequence Database (PIR-PSD) was the world's first database of classified and functionally annotated protein sequences that grew out of the Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure (1965-1978) edited by Margaret Dayhoff. Produced and distributed by the Protein Information Resource in collaboration with MIPS (Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences) and JIPID (Japan International Protein Information Database), PIR-PSD has been the most comprehensive and expertly-curated protein sequence database in the public domain for over 20 years. In 2002, PIR joined EBI (European Bioinformatics Institute) and SIB (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) to form the UniProt consortium. PIR-PSD sequences and annotations have been integrated into UniProt Knowledgebase. Bi-directional cross-references between UniProt (UniProt Knowledgebase and/or UniParc) and PIR-PSD are established to allow easy tracking of former PIR-PSD entries. PIR-PSD unique sequences, reference citations, and experimentally-verified data can now be found in the relevant UniProt records. \n\nLegacy data can be found at \nhttp://pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/dbinfo/pir_psd.shtm"
