## About the Dataset
This dataset has Population Estimates for the National geographic levels in Europe for the years 2008,2014,2019.

The population is categorized by various set of combinations as below:
        
        1. Health-Enhancing Physical Activity by Sex and Educational Attainment level
        2. Health-Enhancing Physical Activity by Sex and Income Quintile
        3. Health-Enhancing Physical Activity by Sex and Degree of Urbanisation
        4. Work-Related Physical Activity by Sex and Educational Attainment level
        5. Work-Related Physical Activity by Sex and Income Quintile
        6. Work-Related Physical Activity by Sex and Degree of Urbanisation
        7. NonWork-Related Physical Activity by Sex and Educational Attainment level
        8. NonWork-Related Physical Activity by Sex and Income Quintile
        9. NonWork-Related Physical Activity by Sex and Degree of Urbanisation
        10. Health-Enhancing NonWork-Related Physical Activity by Sex and Educational Attainment level
        11. Health-Enhancing NonWork-Related Physical Activity by Sex and Income Quintile
        12. Health-Enhancing NonWork-Related Physical Activity by Sex and Degree of Urbanisation
        13. Health-Enhancing Physical Activity by Sex and Country of Birth
        14. Health-Enhancing Physical Activity by Sex and Country of Citizenship
        15. Health-Enhancing Physical Activity by Sex and Degree of Activity Limitation
        16. Health-Enhancing NonWork-Related Physical Activity by Sex and BMI
        17. Daily Physical Activity by Sex and Educational Attainment level
