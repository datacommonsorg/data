### Overview

This dataset has the employee per sector (thousand persons) for European Union (EU) countries specified by their NUTS3 geos. It has the employees and employed persons counts categorized by NACE classification for 15 different economic activities in [1995-2018]. The NACE categories are as follows:

ISCED standard education levels: 

- Total – All NACE activities.
- A – Agriculture, forestry and fishing.
- B-E – Industry (except construction).
- C – Manufacturing.
- F – Construction.
- G-J – Wholesale and retail trade, transport, accommodation and food service activities, information and communication.
- G-I – Wholesale and retail trade, transport, accommodation and food service activities.
- J – Information and communication.
- K-N – Financial and insurance activities, real estate activities, professional, scientific and technical activities, administrative and support service activities.
- K – Financial and insurance activities.
- L – Real estate activities.
- M_N – Professional, scientific and technical activities, administrative and support service activities
- O-U – Public administration and defence, compulsory social security, education, human health and social work activities, arts, entertainment and recreation... .
- O-Q – Public administration, defence, education, human health and social work activities.
- R-U – Arts, entertainment and recreation, other service activities, activities of household and extra-territorial organizations and bodies.


The original dataset is broken up into the following major families of variables:
1. Date: Years from 1995 to 2018 with some holes in time series marked with note "b" in the original dataset
2. nace_r2,wstatus,unit,geo: e.g. THS,EMP,A,AT (Thousand, Employed Person, NACE/A, nuts/AT)
3. value: some with note "p" = "provisional", "u" = "low reliability", and "d" = "definition differs"

nace_r2,wstatus,unit,geo is further broken down into:
1. wstatus-nace: 'EMP_A', 'EMP_B-E', 'EMP_C','EMP_F', 'EMP_G-I', 'EMP_G-J', 'EMP_J', 'EMP_K', 'EMP_K-N', 'EMP_L', 'EMP_M_N', 'EMP_O-Q', 'EMP_O-U', 'EMP_R-U', 'EMP_TOTAL'
2. unit: Thousand
3. geo: NUTS3 codes for regions of Europe

The cleaned csv is broken up into 5 major families of variables:
1. Date: Subset of years from 1995 to 2018 with values in the original dataset
2. GeoID: NUTS3 codes
3. Count_Person_Employed_NACE/A: float values 
4. Count_Person_Employed_NACE/B-E: float values 
5. Count_Person_Employed_NACE/C: float values 
6. Count_Person_Employed_NACE/F: float values 
7. Count_Person_Employed_NACE/G-I: float values 
8. Count_Person_Employed_NACE/G-J: float values 
9. Count_Person_Employed_NACE/J: float values 
10. Count_Person_Employed_NACE/K: float values 
11. Count_Person_Employed_NACE/K-N: float values 
12. Count_Person_Employed_NACE/L: float values 
13. Count_Person_Employed_NACE/M-N: float values 
14. Count_Person_Employed_NACE/O-Q: float values 
15. Count_Person_Employed_NACE/O-U: float values 
16. Count_Person_Employed_NACE/R-U: float values 
17. Count_Person_Employed: float values 


### Notes and Caveats

- There are breaks in the time series of the original dataset. Note =”b”, value=":"
- There are estimated values in the original dataset. Note =”e”
- There are provisional values. Note = "p"
- There are values that definition differs. Note = "d"
- As written, we're importing the estimated, low reliable, and different definitions values as regular values.

## About the Import

### Artifacts

#### Cleaned Data
[Eurostats_NUTS3_Empers.csv](./Eurostats_NUTS3_Empers.csv)

#### Template MCFs
[Eurostats_NUTS3_Empers.tmcf](./Eurostats_NUTS3_Empers.tmcf)

#### StatisticalVariable Instance MCF
[Eurostats_NUTS3_Empers.mcf](./Eurostats_NUTS3_Empers.mcf)

#### Scripts
[emp_persec_preprocess_gen_tmcf.py](./emp_persec_preprocess_gen_tmcf.py)

#### Pre-Processing Validation

Automated validation:
1. In the processing script (next section), assert to check numerical values are correctly formatted.

#### Processing Steps

`Eurostats_NUTS3_Empers.mcf` is handwritten.

To generate `Eurostats_NUTS3_Empers.tmcf` and `Eurostats_NUTS3_Empers.csv`, run:

```bash
python3 emp_persec_preprocess_gen_tmcf.py
```

#### Post-Processing Validation

- Wrote and ran
  [csv_template_mcf_compatibility_checker.py](./csv_template_mcf_compatibility_checker.py)
  to validate that the resulting CSV and Template MCF artifacts are
  compatible.
