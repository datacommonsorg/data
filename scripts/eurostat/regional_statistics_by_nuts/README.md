## About the Datasets

EuroStat Regional Statistics reports demographic data at these geo levels:

- Countries
- NUTS1
- NUTS2
- NUTS3 (not all vars)

The provided NUTS codes are resolved by DCID, based on the fact that the DCIDs
of NUTS geos are `nuts/` + the NUTS ID.

NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) is a hierarchical classification for dividing regions of Europe.

## Imported datasets:

- Birth, deaths, and migrations (by NUTS3)
- Education attainment by gender (by NUTS2)
- Education enrollment by gender (by NUTS2)
- Employed per sector (by NUTS3)
- Fertility rate, median and mean age of mothers at childbirth (by NUTS3)
- Various measures of GDP (by NUTS3)
- Life expectancy by age and gender (by NUTS2)
- Population density (by NUTS3)

See the READMEs in the individual subdirectories for more information about
each import's variables.

## Unfinished work:

- Moratality rate by cause (NUTS2): There is some in-progress work in the now-closed
  [PR 146](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/data/pull/146). Part of that PR
  is checked in ("Birth, deaths, and migrations (by NUTS3)" above).
  If this work is picked up again, there may need to be careful work to make
  sure the enums reuse existing causes of death enums if applicable.
