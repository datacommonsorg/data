## About the Dataset

- ### Download URL

The human disease ontology data can be downloaded from their official github repository [here](https://www.vmh.life/#human/all). The data is in `.owl` format and had to be parsed into a `.csv` format (see [Notes and Caveats](#notes-and-caveats) for additional information on formatting).

- ### Overview

This directory stores the script used to convert the dataset obtained from DO into a modified version, for effective ingestion of data into the Data Commons knowledge graph.

The Disease Ontology database provides a standardized ontology for human diseases, for the purposes of consistency and reusability. It has contains extensive cross mapping of DO terms to other databases, namely, MeSH, ICD, NCIâ€™s thesaurus, SNOMED and OMIM. More information on the database can be found [here](https://disease-ontology.org).

- ### Schema Overview

The schema representing reaction, metabolite and microbiome data from VMH is defined in [DO.mcf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suhana13/ISB-project/main/combined_list.mcf) and [DO.mcf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suhana13/ISB-project/main/combined_list_enum.mcf).

This dataset contains several instances of the class `Disease` and it has multiple properties namely, "parent", "diseaseDescription", "alternativeDOIDs", "diseaseSynonym", "commonName", "icdoID", "meshID", "nciID", "snowmedctusID", "umlscuiID", "icd10CMID", "icd9CMID", "orDOID", "gardID", "omimID", "efoID", "keggDiseaseID", and "medDraID"

- ### Notes and Caveats

The data was present in a `.owl` format. So, it had to be carefully parsed into a `.csv` format for its easy ingestion in the data commons knowledge graph. The parsing might have added a little to the total runtime of the data processing python script.
