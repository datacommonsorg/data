name: "GeneFeatureTypeEnum"
typeOf: schema:Class
subClassOf: dcs:Enumeration
description: "Features are annotated on RefSeq Functional Element NG_ records based on review of the scientific literature. Annotated features are in accord with INSDC Feature Table specifications, where some INSDC feature keys have specific feature classes, e.g., the 'misc_recomb' and 'regulatory' feature keys. In addition, RefSeq-specific controlled vocabulary terms are sometimes used to provide further feature specificity, e.g., for 'misc_feature', or 'misc_recomb' or 'regulatory' features that are not defined by a specific feature class."
