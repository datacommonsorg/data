## About the Dataset

### Download URL

Data is available for downloading at [UniProt Species Download](https://www.uniprot.org/docs/speclist.txt).
 
### Overview

As shown on [UniProt Controlled Vocabulary help page](https://www.uniprot.org/help/controlled_vocabulary): “The Controlled vocabulary of species contains two sublists: the Real organism codes, which are used in both UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL and which correspond to a specific and specified organism; the Virtual organism codes that regroup organisms at a certain taxonomic level. They generally correspond to a 'pool' of organisms and are used only in UniProtKB/TrEMBL.”

We imported this species dataset as [Species](https://datacommons.org/browser/Species) class in Data Commons. There were eight Species instances in Data Commons before. We updated the eight existing instances with new properties while kept their DCIDS. We also created the remaining Species instances from the dataset. The data MCF generated by this script includes all the Species instances and should replace the old Species.mcf data MCF file. Then currently there are 26423 Species instances in total. The [Protein](https://datacommons.org/browser/Protein) class and [Gene](https://datacommons.org/browser/Gene) class link to [Species](https://datacommons.org/browser/Species) class through the property [ofSpecies](https://datacommons.org/browser/ofSpecies) in Data Commons.

### Notes and Caveats

There are eight species saved in [Species.mcf](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/data/blob/master/scripts/organismSpecies/Species.mcf) in Data Commons already, and they are 'HomoSapiens', 'CaenorhabditisElegans', 'DanioRerio', 'DrosophilaMelanogaster', 'GallusGallus', 'MusMusculus', 'SaccharomycesCerevisiae', 'XenopusLaevis'. During the importing, we kept the DCIDs of these eight species to retain the existing links in Data Commons.

## About the import

### Artifacts

#### Scripts 

[parse_species.py](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/data/blob/master/scripts/organismSpecies/parse_species.py) 

[parse_species_test.py](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/data/blob/master/scripts/organismSpecies/parse_species_test.py) 


### Import Procedure

#### Processing Steps 


To generate 'newSpecies.mcf' which contains the data MCF of all species, run:

```bash
python3 parse_species.py -f speclist.txt --old_mcf Species.mcf --output_mcf newSpecies.mcf
```

'Species.mcf' file contains the eight old species instances.

To test the script, run:

```bash
python3 parse_species_test.py
```
