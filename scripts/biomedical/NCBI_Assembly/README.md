## About the Dataset

### Download URL

Assembly report data can be downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Assembly database using their [Genomes FTP Site](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/). Thus far the latest assembly versions for human genomes hg19 ([GRCh37](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/001/405/GCF_000001405.13_GRCh37/GCF_000001405.13_GRCh37_assembly_report.txt)) and hg38 ([GRCh38](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/001/405/GCF_000001405.26_GRCh38/GCF_000001405.26_GRCh38_assembly_report.txt)) have been downloaded. The data is roughly in tab delimited format (see [Notes and Caveats](#notes-and-caveats) for additional information on formatting).

### Database Overview

This directory stores the script used to import assembly report datasets from NCBI Assembly database. Assembly contains information on genome assemblies including their structure, collection of completely sequenced chromosomes, and unaligned sequence fragments More on the nature of the data contained in Assembly can be found on their [website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/help/).

### Schema Overview

The schema representing data from NCBI assembly reports is represented in [GenomeAnnotation.mcf](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/schema/blob/main/biomedical_schema/genome_annotation.mcf) and [GenomeAnnotationEnum.mcf](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/schema/tree/main/biomedical_schema/genome_annotation_enum.mcf).

The assembly reports contains instances of entities "GenomeAssembly", "GenomeAssemblyUnit", and "Chromosome". All of these are connected to entity "Species" by property "ofSpecies". "GenomeAssemblyUnit" and "Chromosome" are connected to "GenomeAssembly" entities with property "inGenomeAssembly". "Chromosome" is connected to "GenomeAssemblyUnit" entities by property "inGenomeAssemblyUnit". Finally, genome sequences of type "Chromosome" that are unlocalized scaffolds link to associated "Chromosome" entity by property "inChromosome".

For a "GenomeAssembly" entity whether the assembly is a full genome representation or if RefSeq and GenBank assemblies are identical are represented as boolean values of the properties "isGenomeRepresentationFull" and "isRefSeqGenBankAssembliesIdentical" respectively. Properties representing "genomeAssemblyType", "genomeAssemblyReleaseType", "genomeAssemblyLevel", and "refSeqCategory" are represented by ennummerations "GenomeAssemblyTypeEunum", "GenomeAssemblyReleaseTypeEnum", "GenomeAssemblyLevelEnum", and "RefSeqCategoryEnum" respectively. "GenomeAssembly" has additional text value properties "ncbiTaxonID", "ncbiBioProject", "submitter", "date", "description", "ncbiAssemblyName", "genBankAssemblyAccession", and "refSeqAssemblyAccession".

For "GenomeAssemblyUnit" text value properties include "genBankAccession" and "refSeqAccession".

For "Chromosome" text value properties include "ncbiDNASequenceName", "genBankAccession", and "refSeqAccession". It also includes "Quantity" value "chromosomeSize" with unit "BasePairs". The property "dnaSequenceRole" property is represented by enummeration "dnaSequenceRoleEnum".

### Notes and Caveats

Assembly includes viral, prokaryotic, eukaryotic genomes including historical genome assemblies. However, here we only include a subset of the most recent versions of major genome assemblies. The raw data of additional genome assembly reports can be found in [this directory](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/).

Please also note that while assembly report files are loosely tab delimited some data is separated by ":" plus whitespace from its property name. When using the script `format_NCBI_Chromosome.py` to generate data mcfs from the assembly report files of new genomes or new versions of a genome, we recommed reviewing the output mcf for changes in spacing or data separation to ensure that no changes had been made in data formatting of the input file, which effects the output file formatting.

## About the import

### Artifacts

#### Scripts

`format_NCBI_Chromosome.py`

#### Files

`GCF_000001405.39_GRCh38.p13_assembly_report.txt`

### Import Procedure

#### Processing Steps 

To generate the data mcf from assembly reports datasets from NCBI Assembly run:

```bash
python3 format_NCBI_Chromosome.py file_input file_output genome species_abrv
```
Description: Converts an NIH NCBI assembly reports file on a genome assembly into a mcf output file populating "GenomeAssembly", "GenomeAssemblyUnit", and "Chromosome" entities.

@file_input		path to the input NCBI file on a genome assembly
@file_output	path to the output mcf file to write the reformatted data
@genome 		the shorthand name for the genome assembly represented in the file (e.g. hg38, mm10)
@species_abrv	the abbreviation used by Data Commons to represent species dcid (e.g. hs, mm)

#### Post-Processing Steps

Review output file for issues in incorrect parsing of whitespace for examples of each entity generated "GenomeAssembly", "GenomeAssemblyUnit", and "Chromosome". If incorrect parsing occurs, update `format_NCBI_Chromosome.py` to ensure correct parsing of properties and thier associated values for each entity.

We also recommend checking the input file for new properties or ennumeration types present in the input file. If this is the case, please update the schema GenomeAnnotationEnum.mcf for updates to ennumeration entities and GenomeAnnotation.mcf for updates in properties. Schema changes are manually curated and not script generated for this script. Please note that an error will be thrown for new properties of "GenomeAssembly", but not "GenomeAssemblyUnit" or "Chromosome". There will be a custom error message for new enummeration entities in the input file. Please update the list of current enummeration values for each Enummeration class in `format_NCBI_Chromosome.py` in addition to adding them to the schema to ensure that the message is only thrown when an enummeration type is not currently in the schema.

### Test

To practice generating a data mcf from an assembly report dataset, in this case hg38 (GRCh38) run:

```bash
python format_NCBI_Chromosome.py GCF_000001405.39_GRCh38.p13_assembly_report.txt hg38_genome_assembly.mcf hg38 hs
```
