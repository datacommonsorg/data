# UN Stats Sustainable Development Goals

This import includes country-level data from the [UN SDG Global Database](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal). Data is read from the submodule `sdg-dataset` which is managed by UN Stats.


To generate city dcids:
```
python3 cities.py <DATACOMMONS_API_KEY>
```
(Note: many of these cities will require manual curation, so this script likely should not be rerun.)

To process data and generate artifacts:
```
python3 process.py
```
Produces:
* schema/ folder: 
  * measurement_method.mcf
  * schema.mcf (classes and enums)
  * sdg.textproto (vertical spec)
  * series.mcf (series mcf)
  * sv.mcf
  * unit.mcf
* csv/ folder: 
  * [CODE].csv
(Note that the `schema/` folder is not included in the repository but can be regenerated by running the script.)

To run unit tests: 
```
python3 -m unittest discover -v -s ../ -p "*_test.py"
```
