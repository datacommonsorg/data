# UN Stats Sustainable Development Goals

This import includes data from the [UN SDG Global Database](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal). Data is read from the submodule `sdg-dataset` which is managed by UN Stats. Geography mappings are read from the submodule `sssom-mappings` which is also managed by UN Stats.


To generate place mappings:
```
python3 geography.py
```
Produces:
* geography/ folder:
  * un_places.mcf (place mcf)
  * un_containment.mcf (place containment triples)
  * place_mappings.csv (map of SDG code -> dcid)

Note that the `place_mappings.csv` is required before running the `process.py` script.

To process data and generate artifacts:
```
python3 process.py
```
Produces:
* schema/ folder: 
  * measurement_method.mcf
  * schema.mcf (classes and enums)
  * sdg.textproto (vertical spec)
  * series.mcf (series mcf)
  * sv.mcf
  * unit.mcf
* csv/ folder: 
  * [CODE].csv
(Note that these folders are not included in the repository but can be regenerated by running the script.)

When refreshing the data, the `geography`, `schema`, and `csv` folders might all get updated and will need to be resubmitted to g3. The corresponding TMCF file is `sdg.tmcf`.

To run unit tests: 
```
python3 -m unittest discover -v -s ../ -p "*_test.py"
```

Notes:
* We currently drop certain series and variables (refer to `util.py` for the list) which have been identified by UN as potentially containing outliers.
