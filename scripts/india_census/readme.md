## Base Class - CensusPrimaryAbstractDataLoaderBase
`india_census.common.base.CensusPrimaryAbstractDataLoaderBase` is the base class for all census primary abstract data loaders. It has all the features required to clean and process the data. A specific census dataset loader can extend this class and can override any methods if required.

It has one public function `process()` which internally downloads the data, cleans the data, creates the MCF, TMCF, and cleaned CSV file.
