#### Cleaned Data
As part of the cleaning process, we remove the unwanted columns and then convert the columns into rows. Then add the `StatisticalVariable` column corresponding to census variable and TRU.

Cleaned data [IndiaCensus2011_Primary_Abstract_ScheduleCaste.csv](IndiaCensus2011_Primary_Abstract_ScheduleCaste.csv) will have the following columns.

- census_location_id - indianCensusAreaCode2011
- TRU - TRU
- columnName - census variable name
- StatisticalVariable - statistical variable
- Value - Value for the attribute
- Year - Census year
