<p>The Uniform Crime Reporting Program collects data about both single-bias and multiple-bias hate crimes.Â  For each offense type reported, law enforcement must indicate at least one bias motivation.Â  A single-bias incident is defined as an incident in which one or more offense types are motivated by the same bias.Â  A multiple-bias incident is defined as an incident in which more than one offense type occurs and at least two offense types are motivated by different biases.</p>
