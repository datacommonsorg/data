For each offense type reported, law enforcement must indicate at least one bias motivation. A single-bias incident is defined as an incident in which one or more offense types are motivated by the same bias. A multiple-bias incident is defined as an incident in which more than one offense type occurs and at least two offense types are motivated by different biases. </p> <ul> <li>In 2008, 13,690 law enforcement agencies submitted hate crime data to the UCR Program.
