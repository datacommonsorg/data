<h1>Incidents and Offenses </h1>
<p class="download_primary"><a href="downloadablepdfs/incidentsoffenses.pdf">Download Printable Document</a></p>
<p>The UCR Program collects data about both single-bias and multiple-bias hate crimes. For each offense type reported, law enforcement must indicate at least one bias motivation. A single-bias incident is defined as an incident in which one or more offense types are motivated by the same bias. A multiple-bias incident is defined as an incident in which more than one offense type occurs and at least two offense types are motivated by different biases. </p>
