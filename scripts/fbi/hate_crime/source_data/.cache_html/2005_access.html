<h1>Incidents and Offenses </h1>
<a href="/ucr/hc2005/docdownload/incidentsandoffenses.pdf" class="download_secondary">Download Printable Document (PDF)</a> <br />
<p>The UCR Program collects data about both single-bias and multiple-bias hate crimes. For each offense type reported, law enforcement must indicate one bias motivation. A single-bias incident occurs when one or more offense types within the incident are motivated by the same bias. A multiple-bias incident occurs when more than one offense type occurs in the incident and at least two offense types are motivated by a different bias. </p>
<ul>
<li> In 2005, 12,417 law enforcement agencies submitted hate crime data to the UCR Program. (See <a href="abouthc.htm#contributingagencies">Number of Participating Agencies and Population Covered</a>.) Of those, 2,037 law enforcement agencies reported the occurrence of 7,163 hate crime incidents. </li>
<li> The 7,160 single-bias incidents involved 8,373 offenses, 8,795 victims and 6,800 offenders. </li>
