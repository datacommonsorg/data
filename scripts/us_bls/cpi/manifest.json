CPI-W stands for CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. The two are both unchained and use the same basket of goods and prices. The difference is their population group. C-CPI-U stands for Chained CPI for All Urban Consumers. It is the chained version of CPI-U. Each of the three can have seasonally adjusted and unadjusted series.",
