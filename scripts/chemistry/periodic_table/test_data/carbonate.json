When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example \"H2SO4\" for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version \"H2O4S.\"",

Porous calcium carbonate scaffolds were droplet seeded with hBMSCs using a matrix containing 3 % fibrinogen and cultured for 3 weeks. Seeded scaffolds without the fibrin matrix served as controls. The scaffolds were evaluated, using undecalcified thick sections, for fluorescence staining for nuclei, osteocalcin (OC) and VEGF. The sections were systematically scanned using optical sectioning and three dimensional distributions of cells and positive staining indicating expression of OC and VEGF were reconstructed from the z-stacks. The fibrin matrix maintained a significantly higher level of cell numbers after 2 d and 1 week and delayed the onset of osteogenic differentiation while sustaining a significantly higher level of OC and VEGF expression after 2 and 3 weeks, starting from the periphery of the scaffolds. There was a decrease in cell density from the periphery to the centre of the scaffolds in both groups. The percentage of cells expressing OC and VEGF was significantly different between the centre and the periphery of the scaffolds in the fibrin(+) group but not in the controls. It is concluded that the fibrin matrix used appears to be a useful adjunct for supporting and sustaining osteogenic and angiogenic activity of hBMSCs in tissue engineered constructs. This could help to improve their performance in a clinical setting.",

Macroporous constructs with 125 ug human recombinant osteogenic protein-1 (hOP-1) or 125 ug human recombinant transforming growth factor-beta(3) (hTGF-beta(3)) were also implanted. The potential synergistic interaction between morphogens was tested by implanting binary applications of hOP-1 and hTGF-beta(3) 5:1 by weight, respectively. To evaluate the role of osteoclastic activity on the implanted macroporous surfaces, coral-derived constructs were pre-loaded with 0.24 mg of bisphosphonate zoledronate (Zometa). To correlate the morphology of tissue induction with osteogenic gene expression and activation, harvested specimens on day 90 were analyzed for changes in OP-1 and TGF-beta(3) mRNA synthesis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The induction of bone formation in 7% HA/CC solo correlated with OP-1 expression. Massive bone induction formed by binary applications of the recombinant morphogens. Single applications of hOP-1 and hTGF-beta(3) also resulted in substantial bone formation, not comparable however to synergistic binary applications. Zoledronate-treated macroporous constructs showed limited bone formation and in two specimens bone formation was altogether absent; qRT-PCR showed a prominent reduction of OP-1 gene expression whilst TGF-beta(3) expression was far greater than OP-1. The lack of bone formation by zoledronate-treated specimens indicates that osteoclastic activity on the implanted coral-derived constructs is critical for the spontaneous induction of bone formation. Indirectly, zoledronate-treated samples showing lack of OP-1 gene expression and absent or very limited bone formation by induction confirm that the spontaneous induction of bone formation by coral-derived macroporous constructs is initiated by secreted BMPs/OPs, in context the OP-1 isoform.",

Many older women with osteoporosis have phosphorus intakes of <70% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance. /The study's/ objective was to test the hypothesis that calcium phosphate would better support anabolic bone building than would calcium carbonate. This study was a 12-mo, randomized, positive-comparator, 2-arm, single-blind clinical trial in 211 patients treated with teriparatide who consumed <1000 mg phosphorus/d. Participants were randomly assigned to receive, in addition to teriparatide and 1000 IU cholecalciferol, 1800 mg calcium/d as either tricalcium phosphate or calcium carbonate. The primary endpoints were changes in lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral densities (BMDs); secondary endpoints were changes in bone resorption biomarkers and serum and urine calcium and phosphorus concentrations. In the combined group, the lumbar spine BMD increased by 7.2%, and total hip BMD increased by 2.1% (P < 0.01 for both). However, there was no significant difference between calcium-treatment groups, and there were no significant between-group differences in serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations or in urine calcium concentrations. Bone resorption biomarkers increased in both groups, as expected with teriparatide, but the increases in the 2 calcium groups did not differ significantly.Tricalcium phosphate and calcium carbonate appear to be approximately equally effective in supporting bone building with a potent anabolic agent; phosphate salt may be preferable in patients with restricted phosphorus intakes.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Current research suggests that calcification will decrease in many species, but compelling evidence of impaired functional performance of calcium carbonate structures is sparse, particularly in key species. Here we demonstrate that ocean acidification markedly degrades the mechanical integrity of larval shells in the mussel Mytilus californianus, a critical community member on rocky shores throughout the northeastern Pacific. Larvae cultured in seawater containing CO2 concentrations expected by the year 2100 (540 or 970 ppm) precipitated weaker, thinner and smaller shells than individuals raised under present-day seawater conditions (380 ppm), and also exhibited lower tissue mass. Under a scenario where mussel larvae exposed to different CO2 levels develop at similar rates, these trends suggest a suite of potential consequences, including an exacerbated vulnerability of new settlers to crushing and drilling attacks by predators; poorer larval condition, causing increased energetic stress during metamorphosis; and greater risks from desiccation at low tide due to shifts in shell area to body mass ratios. Under an alternative scenario where responses derive exclusively from slowed development, with impacted individuals reaching identical milestones in shell strength and size by settlement, a lengthened larval phase could increase exposure to high planktonic mortality rates. In either case, because early life stages operate as population bottlenecks, driving general patterns of distribution and abundance, the ecological success of this vital species may be tied to how ocean acidification proceeds in coming decades.",

A variety of biological responses to ocean acidification have been measured across a range of taxa, but this information exists as case studies and has not been synthesized into meaningful comparisons amongst response variables and functional groups. /The authors/ used meta-analytic techniques to explore the biological responses to ocean acidification, and found negative effects on survival, calcification, growth and reproduction. However, there was significant variation in the sensitivity of marine organisms. Calcifying organisms generally exhibited larger negative responses than non-calcifying organisms across numerous response variables, with the exception of crustaceans, which calcify but were not negatively affected. Calcification responses varied significantly amongst organisms using different mineral forms of calcium carbonate. Organisms using one of the more soluble forms of calcium carbonate (high-magnesium calcite) can be more resilient to ocean acidification than less soluble forms (calcite and aragonite). Additionally, there was variation in the sensitivities of different developmental stages, but this variation was dependent on the taxonomic group. /These/ analyses suggest that the biological effects of ocean acidification are generally large and negative, but the variation in sensitivity amongst organisms has important implications for ecosystem responses.",

Limestone is calcined in a kiln to obtain carbon dioxide and quicklime. The quicklime is mixed with water to produce a milk-of-lime. Dry hydrated lime can also be used as a feedstock. Carbon dioxide gas is bubbled through the milk-of-lime in a reactor known as a carbonator. Gassing continues until the calcium hydroxide has been converted to the carbonate. The end point can be monitored chemically or by pH measurements. Reaction conditions determine the type of crystal, the size of particles, and the size distribution produced. ... Following carbonation, the product can be further purified by screening. This screening, also used to control the maximum size of the product, is followed by dewatering (qv). Rotary vacuum filters, pressure filters, or centrifuges are used in the mechanical removal of water. Final drying is accomplished as with natural calcium carbonate in either a rotary, spray, or flash dryer. Products having mean particle sizes from submicrometers (~0.03 um) to several micrometers are available.",

Apoptotic cells in proximal and distal segments were counted and expressed as an apoptotic index (AI: frequency of apoptosis/100 longitudinal crypts). The bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling index was also determined. Differences were analyzed by the student's t- test ... In control animals, the AI was significantly higher in the caecum/proximal colon (mean, 28.6; SEM, 2.0) compared with the distal colon (mean, 19.9; SEM, 1.8; p = 0.004). In the calcium treated group, the AI in the caecum/proximal colon (mean, 30.6; SEM, 1.7) was similar to controls (p = 0.71) but the AI in the distal colon was significantly greater (mean, 32.6; SEM, 1.8; p = 0.001) than in control mice and was raised to values similar to those in the proximal colon. Calcium was also associated with reduced crypt cellularity and, in the proximal colon, a downward shift in the crypt position at which apoptosis occurred. There were no significant differences in the BrdU labelling index between groups or between proximal and distal colonic segments in each group ... /The authors concluded that/ increased dietary calcium is associated with the induction of apoptosis in normal mouse distal colonic epithelium without affecting cell proliferation. This might contribute to its putative chemopreventive role in colorectal carcinogenesis.",

Unexpectedly, high-calcium phosphate control diet-fed rats had more preneoplastic lesions in the colon than low-Ca control diet-fed rats. The present study was designed to find a Ca supplementation with no adverse effect, by testing several doses and types of Ca salts. One in vitro study and two short-term studies in rats identified calcium carbonate as the most effective Ca salt to bind heme in vitro and to decrease fecal biomarkers previously associated with increased carcinogenesis: fecal water cytotoxicity and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. A long-term carcinogenesis study in dimethylhydrazine-injected rats demonstrated that a diet containing 100 umol/g calcium carbonate did not promote ACF, in contrast with a previously tested calcium phosphate diet. The results suggest that calcium carbonate, and not calcium phosphate, should be used to reduce heme-associated colorectal cancer risk in meat eaters. They support the concept that the nature of the associated anion to a protective metal ion is important for chemoprevention.",

The copper LC50 values for 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr to tilapia in the laboratory were 210.27, 213.34, 193.30, and 185. 75 mg/L, respectively. Prior to Cu exposure, fish were exposed to 0 (G1 and G3) and 30 mg/L calcium carbonate (G2 and G4) for 4 days. After that, fish were exposed to 46 mg/L copper, which corresponds to 25% of the 96 hr LC50 (G3 and G4) for 96 hr and 7 days. In the gills of the copper treatment group, primary filament cell hyperplasia, epithelial lifting, or edema, secondary lamellar fusion, and aneurysm were observed. Swollen hepatocytes showing vacuoles and congestion in sinusoids were observed. Necrosis was observed in some areas. In the kidney, glomerulus's atrophy, tubular swelling, and also necrosis were seen. Fish that were pre-exposed to calcium showed slight alteration when compared to copper alone-treatment groups. Histochemical staining for calcium and copper by alizarin red S and rhodanine staining, respectively, indicated no accumulation of calcium and copper in kidney, liver, gills, and muscle. In conclusion, calcium appears to be beneficial in reducing the effects of heavy metal contaminations in aquatic organisms.",

Water hardness had a significant effect on the acute toxicity of both elements. The 96 hr LC50 values for Co were 91.7 mg/L and 204.8 mg/L in hard and very hard waters, respectively, and for Ni the 96 hr LC50 values were 78.0 mg/L and 127.2 mg/L, respectively.

For this purpose, the acute toxicity tests were performed by 96-hr static tests in different water temperatures and water hardness concentrations. For acute toxicity tests, solutions ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 mg/L were used at 12 °C and solutions ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 mg/L at 17 °C. The LC50 values of HgCl2 that killed 50% of rainbow trout within 96 hr in the hardness concentrations of 35, 70 and 120 mg/L CaCO3 were calculated using probit analysis, and were found to be 0.725, 0.788, 0.855 mg/L at 12 °C and 0.670, 0.741, 0.787 mg/L at 17 °C, respectively. Consequently, the toxicity of HgCl2 on rainbow trout decreased when the temperature decreased from 17 to 12 °C. Toxicity increased when the hardness decreased from 120 to 35 mg/L CaCO3. In contrast to temperature, water hardness presents a negative effect on the toxicity of HgCl2.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",
