## Overview

This project provides an interactive web dashboard for analyzing and comparing key drought and climate indices across all counties in the United States. It transforms raw, publicly available data into a powerful tool for researchers, policymakers, agricultural professionals, and climate enthusiasts.

The application is built with Python and Streamlit and features a fully automated data pipeline using GitHub Actions to ensure the data is always up-to-date.

## Key Features

- **Comparative Analysis:** Visualize and compare three critical drought indices:
  - **SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index):** A measure of short-term meteorological drought.
  - **PDSI (Palmer Drought Severity Index):** A long-term index of soil moisture balance.
  - **SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index):** A modern index factoring in precipitation and water loss from temperature changes.
- **Comprehensive Time-Series Analysis:** Perform several types of analysis on the data for any U.S. county:
  - Trend Analysis
  - Anomaly Detection
  - Seasonal Decomposition
  - Autocorrelation
  - Statistical Forecasting
- **Fully Automated Data Pipeline:** A robust shell script (`run_pipeline.sh`) handles downloading the latest raw data, processing it, and preparing it for the dashboard.
- **Live Data Refresh:** A GitHub Actions workflow runs weekly, automatically executing the data pipeline and committing the updated dataset. The deployed dashboard stays current with no manual intervention.
- **Interactive and User-Friendly:** An intuitive interface built with Streamlit makes complex data accessible to everyone.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Git and Git LFS

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vishalworkdatacommon/climate_dashboard_unified.git
    cd climate_dashboard_unified
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the automated data pipeline:**
    This script will download all necessary data from the source and prepare it for the application. This step may take some time.
    ```bash
    # Make the script executable
    chmod +x run_pipeline.sh

    # Run the pipeline
    ./run_pipeline.sh
    ```

## Running the Dashboard Locally

Once the setup is complete, launch the Streamlit dashboard with this command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
