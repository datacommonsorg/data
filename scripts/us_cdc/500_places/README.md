## About the Dataset

### Download URL
The datasets can be downloaded at the following links from [the CDC website](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/browse?category=500+Cities+%26+Places&sortBy=newest&utf8).
- [PLACES: Local Data for Better Health, Census Tract Data](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-Census-Tract-D/cwsq-ngmh)
- [PLACES: Local Data for Better Health, County/Country Data](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-County-Data-20/swc5-untb)
- [PLACES: Local Data for Better Health, Place (City) Data](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-Place-Data-202/eav7-hnsx)
- [PLACES: Local Data for Better Health, ZCTA (Zip Code) Data](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-ZCTA-Data-2020/qnzd-25i4)

To download all datasets available, run the following command. The download will take 5-10 minutes total. Files will be downloaded and extracted to a `raw_data` folder.
```bash
$ python3 download_bulk.py
```

All the downloaded data is in .csv format. 

### Overview
The data imported in this effort is from the CDC's [500 Places project](https://www.cdc.gov/places/about/index.html), a continuation of the [500 Cities project](https://www.cdc.gov/places/about/500-cities-2016-2019/index.html), and is provided by the CDC's [National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/index.htm). The datasets contain "estimates for 27 measures: 5 chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors, 13 health outcomes, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities."

### Notes and Caveats
