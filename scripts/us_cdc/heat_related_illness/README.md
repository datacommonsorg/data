# Importing CDC Wonder Natality Data

This directory imports [Heat and Heat-related Illness] from EPH Tracking (https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/qrlist/35) into Data Commons. It includes data at a state level.

## Data Caveats:
- Suppressed data points are skipped.
- Data for heat related deaths is heavily suppressed.
