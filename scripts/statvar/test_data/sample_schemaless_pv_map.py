    # Sample column map.
    # Key is a substring of a row or column header.
    # Value is a dictionary of property-value tuples to be applied to
    # all elements in the row or column.
    # If keys are overlapping, the longest key as a substring of a column is used.
    # A column name can map to multiple keys for different parts of the string
    # and all property-values for matching keys will be applied.
    #
    # Values can have references in the syntax "{variable}".
    # The variable is replaced with the value from the final set of PVs.
    #
    # There are special references:
    # {Number}: refers to the numeric value in a cell.
    # {Data}: refers to other values in a cell that is not mapped to any PVs.
    # <Caps><string>: Use properties starting with a Capital letter to create
    # local variables that are not emitted in the final output, but are place
    # holders for replacements.
