# US: National Center for Education Statistics
## Import Overview:
This dataset has Population Estimates for the National Center for Education Statistics in US for 
- Private School - 1997-98 to 2019-20
- School District -2010-11 to 2023-24
- Public Schools - 2010-11 to 2023-24

## Source URL:
  https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/elsi/tableGenerator.aspx 

## Import Type:
   Using a Selenium script to download data.

## Source Data Availability: P1Y 
  
## Autorefresh Type: Semi-Autorefresh 
  - `/bin/python3 download.py --import_name={"PrivateSchool"(or)"District"(or)"PublicSchool"} --years_to_download= "{select the available years       mentioned under each school type}"`

   For Example:  `/bin/python3 download.py --import_name="PublicSchool" --years_to_download="2023"`.
    - The input_files folder containing all the files will be present in: 
    `scripts/us_nces/demographics/public_school/input_files`

 Note: Give one year at a time for District and Public Schools as there are large number of column values.
 
### upload the files manually to GCP bucket for processing using gsutil command.
    Ex private :
        gsutil cp -r /scripts/us_nces/demographics/private_school/input_files gs://unresolved_mcf/us_nces/demographics/private_school/semi_automation_input_files/
    Ex public :
        gsutil cp -r /scripts/us_nces/demographics/public_school/input_files gs://unresolved_mcf/us_nces/demographics/public_school/semi_automation_input_files/
    Ex district :
        gsutil cp -r /scripts/us_nces/demographics/school_district/input_files gs://unresolved_mcf/us_nces/demographics/school_district/semi_automation_input_files/

### Note:
    The only manual part here is after downloading the input files and then uploading them to gcp bucket. Once they're uploaded, Each import requires its own sh command to copy the files from Google Cloud to a local folder called gcs_output/input_files. From there, a script automatically picks up these files to process them. Finally, it generates the output and saves it in gcs_output/output_files

### Script Execution Details
    private    :  python3 private_school/process.py
    public   :  python3 public_school/process.py
    district  :  python3 school_district/process.py


#### Cleaned Data
    import_name consists of the school name being used 
    - "private_school"
    - "school_district"
    - "public_school"

Cleaned data will be saved as a CSV file within the following paths.
- private_school -> [private_school/output_files/us_nces_demographics_private_school.csv]
- district_school -> [school_district/output_files/us_nces_demographics_district_school.csv]
- public_school -> [public_school/output_files/us_nces_demographics_public_school.csv]

The Columns for the csv files are as follows
- school_state_code 
- year
- sv_name
- observation
- scaling_factor
- unit

## The NCES import script operates as follows:
If it's the beginning of a new year:
-The script downloads the latest data using Selenium.
Otherwise:
-The script retrieves school IDs for Private, Public, and District schools from a local JSON file located at gs://datcom-prod-imports/scripts/us_nces/demographics/school_id_list.json.

The population is categorized on various attributes and their combinations:
        
        1. Count of Students categorised based on Race.
        2. Count of Students categorised based on School Grade from Pre Kindergarten to Grade 13.
        3. Count of Students categorised based on Pupil/Teacher Ratio.
        4. Count of Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Teachers. 
        5. Count of Students with a combination of Race and School Grade. 
        6. Count of Students with a combination of Race and Gender.
        7. Count of Students with a combination of School Grade and Gender.
        8. Count of Students with a combination of Race, School Grade and Gender.
        9. Count of Students under Ungraded Classes, Ungraded Students and Adult Education Students.

### Import Procedure

#### Downloading the input files using scripts.
    - There are 3 scripts created to download the input files.
    - fetch_ncid.py
    - download_config.py
    - download_file_details.py
    - download.py

    #### fetch_ncid.py script
     - The code is a Python function that retrieves National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) IDs for a given school and year. It automates interacting with a webpage using Selenium to select options and then extracts the corresponding IDs.

    ##### download_config.py script  
     - The download_config.py script has all the configurations required to download the file.
     - It has filter, download url, maximum tries etc. The values are same under all cases.

    ##### download_file_details.py script
     - The download_file_details.py script has values for "default column", "columns to be downloaded" and "key coulmns".
     - Every input file can only accommodate 60 columns. In Public Schools multiple input files will be downloaded. All these input files will have a common column called as "Key Column" which acts as primary key.
     - In the "Public columns to be downloaded" create a list of columns.
        -ex: PUBLIC_COLUMNS = ["State Name [Public School]", "State Abbr [Public School]", "School Name [Public School]"]
     - Steps to add columns to the list.
        - Under "Select Table Columns" 
        - select the "Information" tab 
        - expand the hit area "BasicInformation" 
        - right click on the desired column checkbox and choose inspect 
        - from the elements on the right hand side, check the number assigned to "value" and add confirm the column under that list which corresponds to value.

    #### download.py script
     - The download.py script is the main script. It considers the import_name and year to be downloaded. It downloads, extracts and places the input csv in "input_files" folder under the desired school directory.

#### MCFs and Template MCFs
- private_school -> [private_school/gcs_output/output_files/us_nces_demographics_private_school.mcf]
                    [private_school/gcs_output/output_files/us_nces_demographics_private_school.tmcf]


- district_school -> [school_district/gcs_output/output_files/us_nces_demographics_district_school.mcf],
                     [school_district/gcs_output/output_files/us_nces_demographics_district_school.tmcf]


- public_school ->  [public_school/gcs_output/output_files/us_nces_demographics_public_school.mcf],
                    [public_school/gcs_output/output_files/us_nces_demographics_public_school.tmcf]


#### Cleaned Place
"import_name" consists the type of school being executed. 
- "private_school"
- "district_school"
- "public_school"


#### Follow these steps to generate and add new schools 
Cleaned data will be inside as a CSV file with the following paths.
step 1 :
- private_school:
[private_school/gcs_output/output_place/us_nces_demographics_private_place.csv]
- district_school:
[school_district/gcs_output/output_place/us_nces_demographics_district_place.csv]
- public_school:
[public_school/gcs_output/output_place/us_nces_demographics_public_place.csv]

step 2 : Use the command-line tool to do genmcf using the CSV and TMCF files.

`java -jar '/usr/local/google/home/spateriya/Downloads/datacommons-import-tool-0.1-alpha.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar' genmcf -r FULL <place csv path> <place tmcf path>`

step 3 : Update the file path in the textproto files for NCES_PrivateSchool, NCES_PublicSchool, and NCES_SchoolDistrict.


If there are Duplicate School IDs present in School Place, they will be saved inside the same output path as that of csv and tmcf file.
- [scripts/us_nces/demographics/private_school/gcs_output/output_place/dulicate_id_us_nces_demographics_private_place.csv]
- [scripts/us_nces/demographics/school_district/gcs_output/output_place/dulicate_id_us_nces_demographics_district_place.csv]
- [scripts/us_nces/demographics/public_school/gcs_output/output_place/dulicate_id_us_nces_demographics_public_place.csv]


#### Template MCFs Place
- private_school:
[private_school/gcs_output/output_place/us_nces_demographics_private_place.tmcf]
- district_school:
[school_district/gcs_output/output_place/us_nces_demographics_district_place.tmcf]
- public_school:
[public_school/gcs_output/output_place/us_nces_demographics_public_place.tmcf]
