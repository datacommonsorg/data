Ensemble,"University of Massachusetts, Amherst",https://reichlab.io/,The national and state-level ensemble forecasts include models that assume certain social distancing measures will continue and models that assume those measures will not continue.,"Equal-weighted combination of 2 to 11 models, depending on the availability of national and state-level forecasts.

Only one model was available for the forecasts for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands."
