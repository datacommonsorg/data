Auquan,Auquan Data Science,https://covid19-infection-model.auquan.com/,These projections do not make specific assumptions about which interventions have been implemented or will remain in place.,SEIR model
Ensemble,"University of Massachusetts, Amherst",https://reichlab.io/,The national and state-level ensemble forecasts include models that assume certain social distancing measures will continue and models that assume those measures will not continue.,"Equal-weighted combination of 2 to 11 models, depending on the availability of national and state-level forecasts. To ensure consistency, the ensemble includes only models with 4 week-ahead forecasts and models that do not assign a significant probability to there being fewer cumulative deaths than have already been reported. Only one model was available for the forecasts for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands."
Columbia,Columbia University,https://columbia.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=ade6ba85450c4325a12a5b9c09ba796c,"This model is based on assumptions about how levels of social distancing will change in the future.Â  It assumes a 20% reduction in contact rates for each successive week that stay-at-home orders remain in place or are expected to remain in place. Once a state has re-opened, contact rates are assumed to increase by 5% each week.",Metapopulation SEIR model

GA_Tech,"Georgia Institute of Technology, College of Computing",https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/covid.html,This model assumes that the effects of interventions are reflected in the observed data and will continue going forward.,Deep learning
Imperial,"Imperial College, London",https://mrc-ide.github.io/covid19-short-term-forecasts/index.html,These projections do not make specific assumptions about which interventions have been implemented or will remain in place.,"Ensembles of mechanistic transmission models, fit to different parameter assumptions."
ISU,Iowa State University,http://www.covid19dashboard.us/, These projections do not make specific assumptions about which interventions have been implemented or will remain in place.,Nonparametric spatiotemporal model
JHU,Johns Hopkins University,https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/COVIDScenarioPipeline,This model assumes that the effectiveness of interventions is reduced after shelter-in-place orders are lifted.,Stochastic metapopulation SEIR model
LANL,Los Alamos National Laboratory,https://covid-19.bsvgateway.org/,"This model assumes that currently implemented interventions and corresponding reductions in transmission will continue, resulting in an overall decrease in the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths.",Statistical dynamical growth model accounting for population susceptibility

UT,"University of Texas, Austin",https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/projections/,This model estimates the extent of social distancing using geolocation data from mobile phones and assumes that the extent of social distancing will not change during the period of forecasting. The model is designed to predict confirmed COVID-19 deaths resulting from only a single wave of transmission.,Nonlinear Bayesian hierarchical regression with a negative-binomial model for daily variation in death rates
