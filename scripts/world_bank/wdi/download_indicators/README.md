This script is used to download a specific set of indicators from World Bank and
write a cleaned csv to a specified output path. The script will loop through
the set of indicators and download data for all dates/countries for that
indicator.

Currently, the result csv is used in a private Data Commons instance, but can be
reused as necessary.
