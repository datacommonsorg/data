# US Census Geo codes.

## Census Regions and Divisions
The states in the USA are grouped into nine Census Divisions with ids [1-9].
The divisions are further grouped into four Census Regions with ids [1-4].
The grouping are illustrated in [this
page](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf).

The MCF nodes for these are in `geo_CensusDivision.mcf` and are generated by
the script `census_divisions.py`.

### Download data

https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/geographies/2018/state-geocodes-v2018.xlsx and saved as a csv file `census_region_geocodes.csv`.
