# US Census Geo codes.

## Census Regions and Divisions
The states in the USA are grouped into nine Census Divisions with ids [1-9].
The divisions are further grouped into four Census Regions with ids [1-4].

The grouping are illustrated in [this
page](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf).

The MCF nodes for these are in `geo_CensusDivision.mcf` and are generated by
the script `census_divisions.py`.

### Download data

The states and the respective region and divisions has been downloaded from [this
spreadsheet](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/geographies/2018/state-geocodes-v2018.xlsx) and saved as a csv file `census_region_geocodes.csv`.

### Import procedure

To generate the MCF nodes for US census regions and divisions:
download the codes and save it as a csv file: 'geocodes.csv'.
Then run `python3 census_divisions.py --census_divisions_csv=geocodes.csv`
to generate the mcf nodes in `geo_CensusDivision.mcf`.
