# Gender Income Inequality

The script fetches data from Bigquery table datcom-store.dc_kg_latest.StatVarObservation which is generated by Prophet pipelines. Using this data, it calculates gender income inequality defined as:

```
(maleIncome - femaleIncome) / (maleIncome + femaleIncome)
```

NOTE: Currently the code supports computation of gender income inequality, but
it can be extended to compute other kinds of inequality as well.
