# Gender Income Inequality

This import calculates gender income inequality based on US Census data which is defined as
```
(maleIncome - femaleIncome) / (maleIncome + femaleIncome)
```


The import script (process.py) relies fetches on data generated by Prophet pipelines. It reads the input from Bigquery table datcom-store.dc_kg_latest.StatVarObservation and writes the output ta to a CSV file.  Currently the code supports computation of gender income inequality, but it can be extended to compute other kinds of inequality as well.


```Bash

python3 process.py
```

The script writes the output data to gender_income_inequality.csv. This file along with template mcf file gender_income_inequality.tmcf can be used to generate the final mcf file.
