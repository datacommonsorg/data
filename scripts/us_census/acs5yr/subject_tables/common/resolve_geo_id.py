Resolving place dcid given the GEOID string from data,census.gov.

GEOID strings from census are typically 14 characters long that uniquely
identifies a place based on summary level, geographic component and FIPS code.

For example: The GEOID for California is 0400000US06, where
040 - indicates summary-level (in this case, state-level)
00  - indicates geographic variant
00  - indicates geographic component
US  - represents the United States
06  - FIPS code for California State

The code maps the place dcid based on the summary level (eg. state, zip code).
The expected length of the fips_code for each summary level is tabulated in [1].
The expected length of the fips_code can be used to debug issues in geoId
resolution.
