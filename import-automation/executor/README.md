# Import Automation Executor

This directory contains code for the executor of the import automation system,
which runs user scripts, generates CSVs and MCFs, and imports them to the Data
Commons knowledge graph using the importer.

## Local Executor

Run `. run_local_executor.sh --help` for usage.


## Deploying on App Engine

```
gcloud app deploy
```

## Configuring the Executor

The executor has a number of customizable configurations listed in
[app/configs.py](app/configs.py). Some have default values; the others need
explicit values. The Cloud Tasks tasks created by Cloud Build can pass the
configurations to the executor. To edit a configuration:
1. Add the key-value pair to "configs" field in
   data/import-automation/cloudbuild/cloudbuild.yaml if it is not already there
2. Check in the cloudbuild.yaml to GitHub
3. Go to the Cloud Build page on Google Cloud and add the key-value pair as
   a substitution variable to the trigger

Note: A scheduled cron job for updating a dataset inherits some of the
configurations for the run that creates the job. The configurations for a cron
job is stored in the body of the job. To change the configurations for a created
cron job, go to the Cloud Scheduler page on Google Cloud and edit the job
directly, or write a script to query the Cloud Scheduler API (see
https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/reference/rest).

## Running Tests

```
export GITHUB_AUTH_USERNAME=<your username>
export GITHUB_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your access token>
